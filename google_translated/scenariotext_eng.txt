_0.7
What on earth is that?!
_0.10
If you're going to do it, I won't forgive you.
I don't know where or when, but don't complain if you get shot down!
_0.13
One aircraft shot down!
I'm sorry, but I'll let you do it like this!
_0.16
I got the second plane too!
_0.19
It looks like all the planes went down, but
I can't just stay excited.
There's a ghost, which means there's a mothership nearby...
_0.22
Damn it! A reinforcement plane! ?
And...haha!
_0.25
This guy is...YF-29B "Perzival"! ?
Is it the home version of YF-29 “Durandal”?
_0.28
What the hell!
It's called ECM, and the robbers around here have it.
That's not a good piece of equipment!
_0.31
Damn it!
Siegfried 1 begins interception!
_0.34
Tsk, that's quite a feat.
_0.37
It's not just that the specs of the aircraft are high.
He is bold and makes decisions quickly.
There's a pretty good pilot on board...
_0.40
But this way of flying... I remember it somewhere...
_0.43
...This is not the time to think about it.
We have to knock him into the gravitational field!
_0.46
bingo! You did it!
_0.49
Damn it, it's no good!
The output of the conversion armor is too different!
_0.52
Wow!
_0.55
The thrust and output are on a different order of magnitude.
A prototype from a generation ago is no match for that monster!
_0.58
If this continues...!
_0.61
...Zentraedi woman...?
_0.64
A Zentraedi woman. ...that's it...
Are Zentran really that rare these days?
_0.67
Ah... no, that's not what I meant.
That was a rude attitude. I'm sorry…….
_0.70
yeah? wait a moment.
How do you know my name?
_0.73
...No, that's not the problem, who are you? ?
_0.76
He's a completely rude person.
Who are you when you look at such a beautiful woman? ...What?
Also, when you ask someone their name, ask yourself first. right?
_0.79
Damn it!
_0.82
Sigh...
Yeah... that one was bad.
_0.85
I'm Rion Sakaki.
S. M. I'm working as a pilot for the S Sephira branch.
_0.88
This star's S. M. Valkyrie for testing at S branch,
I've come to deliver the YF-25 "Prophecy".
_0.91
Is there any problem with that?
_0.94
Eh, no problem.
Well, I guess I should also introduce myself.
_0.97
My name is Aisha Blanchett.
A lifesaver who saved you from a crash.
_0.100
...Crash?
! ...I see, I was shot down by that YF-29...
_0.103
It may still be confusing, but
As far as our ship's doctor saw, there were no injuries or sequelae.
_0.106
Judging from the aircraft's hit rate and degree of damage,
It seems like just being alive is almost a miracle.
_0.109
It's a miracle...
_0.112
So, what about my aircraft...?
_0.115
It would be faster if you had me look at it.
follow me.
_0.118
...It's so tattered that there's not even a trace to be seen.
_0.121
right.
_0.124
...Even though I say that,
Since I took it apart, it looks even more tattered.
There's a part about that though.
_0.127
Huh? What! ?
You take someone's aircraft without permission...!
_0.130
The purpose was to have the AI delivered,
You don't mind, right?
_0.133
That's true, but....
_0.136
So, how do you even know the purpose? ?
You didn't explain that much earlier!
_0.139
The answer is simple.
This is your destination,
S. M. It's the S Ouroboros branch.
_0.142
Huh?
_0.145
Thank you for your hard work on this mission. Lieutenant Leon Sakaki.
_0.148
S. M. I am the branch manager of the S Ouroboros branch.
Special Forces Major Aisha Blanchett,
Allows you to board the battleship "Gefion".
_0.151
……Are you serious.
I see, so that means you know my name too.
_0.154
Such that.
Well, I never heard that it would be so flashy.
_0.157
...I'm sorry about that.
Special Major Aisha.
_0.160
Hehe, since I'm the superior, I suddenly started fixing things up.
_0.163
Well, I don't mind Aisha.
Titles here, including rank and branch manager, are just decorations.
I also get called by my name.
_0.166
That will help.
_0.169
Well then, Aisha, I'll go ahead and return to Sephira.
Could you lend me one Valkyrie and a fold booster?
I'm worried about the guy who killed me, but for now the mission is complete.
_0.172
Oh, about that.
First of all, may I ask you for a job?
_0.175
Huh?
That's why I need to return to the Sephira branch...
_0.178
It would be nice if you could help me a little.
A request from the savior of my life.
_0.181
Damn, I can't refuse if you say that...
_0.184
So it's okay if you'll do it, right?
Thank you, Leon.
_0.187
Actually, it's an island just below my feet.
A transport ship loaded with materials for variable fighter aircraft,
We were attacked by bandits.
_0.190
The cargo ship succeeded in escaping, but
At that time, the containers were scattered.
My job now is to collect it.
_0.193
It's a chore, isn't it?
It's not the job of a Valkyrie rider...
_0.196
I don't complain.
On this planet, Batroids are used for general purposes,
It's normal to do a job like this.
_0.199
understood.
As a way of repaying your kindness, I'll let you work for me.
_0.202
Hello Leon-kun.
Well then, I asked for your help.
_0.205
Understood.
Then I'll go.
_0.208
Oh...is this the planet Ouroboros?
It's a planet of oceans and islands.
_0.211
Ouroboros is a planet with diverse terrain and climate.
There are deserts and glaciers. This area is just an archipelago.
_0.214
This "Uria Archipelago" is also ouroboros,
It's the most comfortable place to spend time.
_0.217
It's not bad to have a variety of lands.
_0.220
That being said, I can't move around freely right now.
I'll tell you more details later. Take your time...
_0.223
Then, the only aircraft they could lend me was the VF-0...
This is the first variable fighter developed 50 years ago, right?
_0.226
It's a replica of what I did a while ago.
Don't worry, the reaction engine has been overhauled.
_0.229
Moreover, it cannot be transformed...
_0.232
Sorry, but please bear with it this time.
So, what is the ride quality of VF-0 like?
_0.235
The cockpit layout is different.
To be honest, I feel a little uncomfortable.
_0.238
Well, that's right.
Well, maybe it's too late now, but
Should I explain how to operate the Battroid?
_0.241
It seems better to have them do that.
Thank you for your help, Aisha.
_0.244
Well then, I'll start explaining the operation of ``Battroid Form''.
_0.247
During the explanation, the operation settings will be set to the default settings, so
Please be careful.
_0.250
First, let me explain about ``movement operations''.
_0.253
Use the left stick up, down, left, and right to move forward, backward, left, and right.
You cannot move using the direction keys, so be careful.
_0.256
If you press the □ button while tilting the left stick,
Step in that direction.
□Hold down the button to dash.
_0.259
If you press the R2 button while tilting the left stick,
Step in that direction.
Hold down the R2 button to dash.
_0.262
Jumping, which is done with the × button, is also the basic movement.
You can dash even while jumping.
_0.265
The boost gauge will increase when you dash or jump.
When the boost gauge reaches maximum,
Please be careful as you will no longer be able to use it.
_0.268
The boost gauge is
It's the gauge displayed at the bottom left of the cockpit.
_0.271
To prevent this from becoming the maximum,
This means that you need to check while taking action.
_0.274
That's what it is.
As expected from a professional pilot,
I guess there was no need for such a basic explanation.
_0.277
Because the basics are important.
I'm glad to be able to check the operation again like this.
_0.280
That would be nice.
Well then, let me continue the explanation.
_0.283
From here on, newly adopted
I will explain about the ``camera operation system.''
_0.286
With this new system,
By operating the right stick,
Now I can freely operate the camera.
_0.289
oh!
This is amazing.
It's possible to operate the camera more precisely than the aircraft I've been on so far!
_0.292
Press the R3 button to reset the camera to the front.
Press the R3 button again and the camera will turn to the back.
_0.295
It may be difficult until you get used to it, but
You should be able to do actions you've never seen before.
_0.298
Understood. That's it for now,
I have finished explaining about movement and camera operation.
What will you tell me next?
_0.301
Next, let me explain about ``attack operations''.
First, let's talk about the "main weapon".
_0.304
When I say main armament, I mainly mean gun pods.
There are other sniper rifles, too.
I'll stop giving detailed explanations for now.
_0.307
Press the R1 button to aim at the aiming cursor in the center of the screen.
I will attack with my main weapon.
If you keep pressing it, it will attack in rapid succession.
_0.310
□Press the button to aim at the aiming cursor in the center of the screen.
I will attack with my main weapon.
If you keep pressing it, it will attack in rapid succession.
_0.313
However, if you keep firing,
Be careful as the aiming cursor will shift upwards.
_0.316
Either suspend the main weapon's attack, or
Please adjust the aiming cursor with the right stick.
_0.319
I see, this is the most important technique for main weapon shooting.
_0.322
Also, the number of bullets for your main weapon is displayed at the bottom right of the screen, so
Don't forget to check the number of bullets left.
_0.325
If your main weapon runs out of bullets,
Bullets will be automatically reloaded after a certain amount of time.
_0.328
If you want to reload the bullet before it runs out,
You can reload by pressing the R1 button twice quickly.
_0.331
If you want to reload the bullet before it runs out,
You can reload by pressing the □ button twice quickly.
_0.334
I guess I was reloading during the fight.
This will create an opening for the enemy to attack you.
I'll have to think about it and reload.
_0.337
Be careful as reloading will run out of item ammo.
_0.340
Also, you can operate the camera with the right stick even while attacking.
Operate the camera, aim and shoot.
_0.343
If you press the L3 button, it will stop moving and
You will be able to shoot more accurately.
Please try it once.
_0.346
Understood.
However, it is quite difficult to aim for it.
_0.349
That's right. It may feel like that, but don't worry.
In such a case, if you keep pressing the L1 button,
Lock on to the enemy.
_0.352
That's right. It may feel like that, but don't worry.
In such a case, press the R1 button to lock on to the enemy.
_0.355
It's easier to hit if you attack with your main weapon while locked on.
However, be careful as you won't be able to lock onto the enemy if it's far away.
_0.358
You can easily lock onto enemies by holding down the R1 button.
It's easier to hit if you attack with your main weapon while locked on.
However, be careful as you won't be able to lock onto the enemy if it's far away.
_0.361
You can also move while locked on.
If you can move and attack while aiming at the enemy well,
No matter what enemy comes, it will be an easy victory!
_0.364
If you operate the right stick even when locked on,
The aiming cursor moves, allowing you to fine-tune your aim!
_0.367
Make good use of camera operation and lock-on,
Take advantage of the battle.
_0.370
If you are not good at combat and there is nothing you can do,
From My Ship's option menu,
Please select "Beginner Mode".
_0.373
In beginner mode,
When you press the SELECT button,
It will fight automatically.
_0.376
Next, I'll explain about attacks with special weapons.
_0.379
Press the ○ button to move towards the cursor in the center of the screen.
I will attack with special weapons.
_0.382
Press the R2 button to move towards the cursor in the center of the screen.
I will attack with special weapons.
_0.385
The basics are the same as the main weapon I explained earlier.
_0.388
The number of bullets for special weapons is displayed at the bottom right of the screen.
If your special weapon runs out of bullets and there are bullets in your item,
It will reload automatically.
_0.391
If you want to reload the bullet before it runs out,
You can reload by pressing the ○ button twice quickly.
_0.394
If you want to reload the bullet before it runs out,
You can reload by pressing the R2 button twice quickly.
_0.397
So, speaking of typical special weapons...
_0.400
Of course it's a missile.
_0.403
Yes, that's correct. Among those missiles are
You can lock multiple enemies by holding down the ○ button.
Some have multi-lock-on capabilities.
_0.406
Yes, that's correct. Among those missiles are
You can lock multiple enemies by holding down the R2 button.
Some have multi-lock-on capabilities.
_0.409
If you use multi lock-on when there are many enemies,
You can attack multiple enemies at the same time, which is very convenient.
_0.412
Capture the enemy in the ``Missile Lock-on Sight'',
Fire the missile accurately!
_0.415
Missile lock-on sights vary depending on the missile type.
The shape of the site will change.
_0.418
Missile lock-on sights vary depending on the missile type.
The shape of the site will change.
_0.421
It's also important to find a missile that suits you.
_0.424
Okay, next, I'll explain about ``melee attacks''.
_0.427
Press the △ button to perform a melee attack.
If you input it continuously, you can perform continuous melee attacks.
_0.430
Dash fighting by pressing the △ button while dashing.
When making continuous melee attacks
Fight using the left stick down and the △ button.
_0.433
Dash fighting by pressing the △ button while dashing.
When making continuous melee attacks
Use the down direction key and the △ button to launch and fight.
_0.436
Also, if you hold down the △ button for a while and release it,
It becomes a charged melee attack.
_0.439
Melee attacks do not use bullets and have high attack power.
However, since you have to get close to the enemy, you can avoid attacks from the enemy.
Be careful, as there is a high possibility of you getting it.
_0.442
Understood.
I'll make sure to use them properly here and there.
_0.445
Finally, not only the attack method,
I'll also teach you about ``defensive operations.''
_0.448
If you hold down the L2 button, you can block shooting attacks.
_0.451
If you hold down the L1 button, you can block shooting attacks.
_0.454
You can guard against enemy attacks by holding down the L2 button.
_0.457
You can guard against enemy attacks by holding down the L1 button.
_0.460
You can guard against enemy attacks by holding down the R2 button.
_0.463
While guarding, the guard gauge will be consumed.
Be careful because once the gauge runs out, you can't guard it.
_0.466
When you block an enemy's attack, part of the damage will be reduced.
I'll take it as recovery damage though...
_0.469
Recovery damage is
Don't worry, it will recover naturally over time.
_0.472
However, I can't block melee attacks,
Please be careful as you will receive damage as it is.
_0.475
These are the basic operations of Battroid form.
Do you now understand how to operate Battroid form?
_0.478
I'm sorry, but could you please explain it to me again?
_0.481
nothing I can do about it.
Well, let me explain it again.
_0.484
No, it's okay now.
_0.487
Now, please head to the container collection area.
_0.490
The explanation for controlling the Battroid is over.
Now, please head to the collection area.
_0.493
roger that.
_0.496
No, it looks okay.
_0.499
I got it.
Now, please head to the collection area.
_0.502
Understood.
_0.505
So, "Battroid Form/Operation Type A"
I'll start explaining.
_0.508
So, "Battroid Form/Operation Type B"
I'll start explaining.
_0.511
So, "Battroid Form/Operation Type C"
I'll start explaining.
_0.514
Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move forward, backward, left, and right.
You cannot move using the left stick, so be careful.
_0.517
Press the direction key twice in the same direction quickly to step in that direction.
If you hold down the direction key, you'll dash.
_0.520
Press the L1 button to reset the camera to the front.
If you press the L1 button again, the camera will turn to the back.
_0.523
Press the L2 button to reset the camera to the front.
If you press the L2 button again, the camera will turn to the back.
_0.526
The number of bullets for special weapons is displayed at the bottom right of the screen.
If your special weapon runs out of ammo and there is ammo in your item,
It will reload automatically.
_0.529
Why are the rocks on this planet floating?
_0.532
It is not fully understood and cannot be explained, but
Well, it's like a specialty of Ouroboros.
_0.535
What a fantasy planet it is.
As for Ouroboros...
_0.538
On the other hand, if you are talking about Ouroboros,
I'm surprised that you came here without doing any research.
_0.541
The plan was to just hand over the YF-25.
I didn't think it was necessary to look into it in such detail.
_0.544
It might be troublesome to teach them this...
_0.547
This is the collection area.
_0.550
I see, you dropped it in a flashy manner.
_0.553
That's how desperate he was to escape from the bandit.
_0.556
What is a bandit now?
If that's what you mean, it means "thief", right?
_0.559
Deserters, thugs, guerrillas, rogue Zentraedi...
There are many different things, but we all do the same thing.
You can loot as much as you like using Valkyrie.
_0.562
Gather up all the people who are causing trouble to such people and living their lives as they please.
It's called Bandit.
_0.565
In a countryside like this, even the New Joint Forces can't do anything.
That's where private military providers like us come in. That's why.
_0.568
got it.
_0.571
Okay, now that you're satisfied,
Collect the fallen containers.
_0.574
understood.
_0.577
Does that mean you should just bring this one?
_0.580
Such that.
At that rate, I ended up collecting four more items.
_0.583
This is the second one.
_0.586
It's not a very good pace.
_0.589
I've gotten used to flying the VF-0.
At this rate, I'll be able to clean it up quickly.
_0.592
This is my third one.
_0.595
There are only two containers left.
Just a little more, please do your best.
_0.598
...I thought of one thing,
This is a job that requires a lot of manual labor.
Wouldn't it be faster if you helped too?
_0.601
...Now, stop talking nonsense and get to work.
Work, work.
_0.604
Are you ignoring me...
_0.607
This is the fourth one. The next one is the last one.
_0.610
It's not good, it's not good.
It's definitely more useful than other hunters out there.
_0.613
yeah?
What is a hunter?
_0.616
Come to think of it, I need an explanation from there.
On this planet, there is a license that allows you to act as a security maintenance agent.
A person who holds that license is called a hunter.
_0.619
Not just exterminating villains, but also transport, escort, excavating ruins...
S. M. Most of S's work includes
I need a license, which means I need to be a hunter.
_0.622
If so, this job is
Is it okay if I do it?
_0.625
All right.
I'm assuming you're my assistant.
_0.628
got it.
Well then, I'll collect the remaining containers as your assistant.
_0.631
Okay, that's it.
Well, it's been since elementary training.
It's okay to do something like this...
_0.634
Yes, I have collected everything properly. good job.
Come back to the ship quickly.
_0.637
Siegfried 1 will now return to the ship.
_0.640
Hey hey!
You haven't collected all the containers yet.
You can't come back!
_0.643
Yes, get back to work!
_0.646
At first I was worried about what it would be like, but
What, that's not a very good arm.
_0.649
Well, I can handle this much.
_0.652
Passed without a doubt.
I found a nice find.
_0.655
welcome home.
The work was perfect. You did a great job.
_0.658
Thank you for that.
So, I guess this is how I returned the favor?
_0.661
Yes, it really helped me.
_0.664
That one was good.
Well then, I'll let you return to the Sephira branch immediately.
Thank you for your help, Aisha.
_0.667
Oh, about that.
I have some unfortunate news for you, Leon.
_0.670
Bad news?
_0.673
Actually, right after you crashed here.
Ouroboros aurora has started to appear,
I can't leave this planet for the time being!
_0.676
………………Huh?
I can't leave the planet! ?
Hey Aisha, stop making boring jokes.
_0.679
This planet Ouroboros is caused by a spatial distortion called the "fold fault."
It's a particularly dense planet.
_0.682
Commonly known as Ouroboros Aurora.
When the fault is thin
The fold time difference will only occur for a week, but...
_0.685
At this point in time, unless it's a Macross class battleship.
In the first place, the fold itself is impossible.
Folding with Valkyrie would be nothing short of suicidal.
_0.688
Moreover, this time, it is even occurring within the atmosphere.
It is not even possible to go to other areas from the Yuria Archipelago.
I'm in a situation where I can't.
_0.691
So when will it settle down?
Who is that Ouroboros Aurora?
_0.694
I can't say for sure because it's irregular, but
Maybe in January, or maybe a year...
_0.697
forgive me….
A situation like this is completely unexpected...
_0.700
Ah~, ah~. Kohon, Kohon.
_0.703
Ah, I'm still in trouble.
Unable to return to planet due to Ouroboros Aurora
We have staff, but we don't have enough pilots.
_0.706
I wonder if there's a good pilot out there somewhere.
Ah, if I found someone good, I would hire them right away.
_0.709
……………….
_0.712
Good treatment including housing and meals.
_0.715
...I'm sure I'll get paid properly, right?
_0.718
Of course, S. M. I'll treat it as S's business.
_0.721
...From now on, I ask for your help.
_0.724
Now, Lieutenant Rion Sakaki.
you as a special treatment,
S. M. We will hire you as a temporary employee at the S Ouroboros branch.
_0.727
...If you've come this far, you should become what you want.
I'll take care of you, Aisha.
_0.730
Oh, are you finally awake?
Looks like you were quite tired yesterday?
_0.733
Well, if only there were so many troubles.
_0.736
Hehe, that's true too.
_0.739
Please wait a moment.
The repairs to VF-0's transformation mechanism will be completed in a little while.
_0.742
Repair... can you do that?
_0.745
fault? Didn't I say that?
If anything, that's what I specialize in.
_0.748
The branch manager also serves as a mechanic...
_0.751
I told you. The branch manager is like a decoration.
...Now, the repair of the VF-0's transformation mechanism is complete.
_0.754
Oh, thank you for that.
_0.757
...but only up to Gerwalk.
_0.760
Can't you transform into a fighter?
_0.763
Even though it's called a replica, VF-0 is a pre-Interstellar War machine, so
There aren't many parts.
_0.766
I wish there was a better used Valkyrie.
I wanted to prepare it for you, but unfortunately the garage was empty.
This was the only one I had for an event.
_0.769
I guess it's better just because it wasn't a Destroid...
_0.772
oh yeah.
Well then, Rion, how about we do some work as a gift for the repairs?
_0.775
What a celebration...
So, what is your job?
_0.778
Actually, there are still parts dropped by the transport ship.
Please pick it up.
_0.781
I wonder if I'll pick it up again...
_0.784
When this work is finished,
I'll repair it so you can transform it into a fighter.
Look forward to it.
_0.787
Thank you for that.
Well then, I'll go collect some containers.
_0.790
Anyway, how to control Gerwalk.
I should explain it to you, right?
_0.793
ask.
Their habits are so different that I can't settle down.
_0.796
Well then, I'll start explaining the operation of ``Gerwalk form''.
_0.799
First, I will explain the ``transformation method''.
_0.802
Use the direction keys to transform the aircraft.
To transform into Gerwalk form, use the left or right arrow keys.
Press down on the directional keys to return to Battroid form.
_0.805
The movement controls are the same as the basic Battroid form.
Use the left stick up, down, left, and right to move forward, backward, left, and right.
_0.808
The movement controls are the same as the basic Battroid form.
Use the up, down, left, and right direction keys to move forward, backward, left, and right.
_0.811
at the same time as the left stick
□Press the button to step in that direction.
□Hold down the button to dash.
_0.814
at the same time as the left stick
Press the R2 button to step in that direction.
Hold down the R2 button to dash.
_0.817
If you keep pressing the × button
This will give you a climb boost and increase your altitude.
_0.820
This is where it differs from the battroid form,
You can hover in Gerwalk mode.
_0.823
Hovering allows you to float fluffy,
This is the biggest feature of Gerwalk.
_0.826
Press the × button twice quickly and keep holding it.
It becomes a descending boost and the altitude decreases.
_0.829
Other basic operations are the same as in Battroid form.
These are the basic operations of Gerwalk form.
_0.832
It's basically the same as the Battroid form.
Well, it looks like the explanation is over, so I can get to work...
_0.835
Wait, Leon.
Actually, there are some things that I couldn't fully explain last time,
I would also like to explain about the ``menu'' here.
_0.838
Understood.
I wish you a professor, Aisha-sensei.
_0.841
Well, first of all, let's talk about the "Start Menu".
The start menu is
You can display it by pressing the START button.
_0.844
It will be paused while the start menu is displayed, so
There's no problem as long as you calm down and let me choose.
_0.847
You can check various information in the start menu.
I will explain each item starting from the left.
_0.850
In "Status",
How many tune points have you accumulated?
You can see information such as how long it will take to level up.
_0.853
In "Quest", you can check the quest you are currently receiving.
You can also see the quest details and rewards.
_0.856
"Items" allows you to use items.
By using items, you can restore the aircraft's HP.
_0.859
``Map'' displays a map of the area you are currently in.
You can also check your current location and the location of the city.
_0.862
In "System",
You can change the controls and camera settings.
If you want to end the battle or the game, you can choose here.
_0.865
However, you cannot save from the start menu, so
If you want to save, you need to return to My Ship.
_0.868
Also at the entrance of the town and the entrance of each dungeon.
You can save it.
_0.871
Well, anyway, I forgot the content of the quest,
If you are having trouble knowing where you are,
All you have to do is open the start menu.
_0.874
Understood.
If you have any trouble, just press the START button...
_0.877
Yeah.
Please remember this carefully.
Next, I'll explain about the ``weapon change menu.''
_0.880
Actually, the Valkyrie you are currently riding is
It is equipped with a variety of equipment to handle various situations.
_0.883
For example, in addition to the gun pod, the main weapon is
It's equipped with a sniper rifle.
You can change your weapon by opening the weapon change menu.
_0.886
By pressing the R2 button,
The weapon change menu will be displayed.
_0.889
By pressing the ○ button,
The weapon change menu will be displayed.
_0.892
By pressing the L2 button,
The weapon change menu will be displayed.
You can also cancel by pressing the L2 button again.
_0.895
What you should be careful about is:
The weapon change menu is different from the start menu.
It won't be suspended. Please be careful.
_0.898
By pressing each button while the weapon change menu is displayed,
You can change the weapons assigned to each button.
_0.901
Main weapon with direction keys,
Use the ○ button, × button, △ button, and □ button to activate special weapons.
It can be changed.
_0.904
In the start menu, items can be used,
It is also possible to recover the aircraft.
_0.907
In addition, you can check the status of the aircraft, etc.
Check the quest you are currently receiving,
You can also check your current location on the map.
_0.910
Also, if you want to end a battle or end the game, you can do so from the menu.
However, you cannot save from the menu, so
If you want to save, please return to my ship.
_0.913
After pressing the R2 button,
Use the direction keys, × button, △ button, □ button,
You can change the weapons assigned to each button.
_0.916
After pressing the ○ button,
Use the direction keys, × button, △ button, □ button,
You can change the weapons assigned to each button.
_0.919
After pressing the L2 button,
Use the direction keys, × button, △ button, □ button,
You can change the weapons assigned to each button.
_0.922
It's convenient to be able to change weapons on the fly.
You can now change your weapons to suit the situation.
I have to do it.
_0.925
You can also change your special attack.
_0.928
If you choose weapons according to the situation, you can advance the battle to your advantage.
_0.931
By pressing the L3 and R3 buttons at the same time
You can purge additional equipment.
_0.934
Yes, that's the end of this explanation.
Do I need to hear it again?
_0.937
I'm sorry, but please try again.
_0.940
Well, let me explain it again.
Listen carefully this time.
_0.945
Now, head to the collection area.
_0.948
It doesn't seem necessary. If you ride it, you'll know how it feels.
_0.951
Now, head straight to the collection area.
_0.954
Then, "Gerwalk form/operation type A"
I'll start explaining.
_0.957
Then, "Gerwalk form/operation type B"
I'll start explaining.
_0.960
Then, "Gerwalk form/operation type C"
I'll start explaining.
_0.963
Use the left stick to transform the aircraft.
To transform into Gerwalk form, press the left or right stick.
Press down on the left stick to return to Battroid form.
_0.968
By pressing the L1 button and the □ button at the same time,
The weapon change menu will be displayed.
_0.971
By pressing the R3 button,
The weapon change menu will be displayed.
You can also cancel by pressing the R3 button again.
_0.974
Armed with the ○ button, × button, △ button, and □ button
It can be changed.
_0.977
By pressing the L2 button and the ○ button at the same time
You can purge additional equipment.
_0.980
By pressing the L2 and R2 buttons at the same time
You can purge additional equipment.
_0.983
I was curious,
Why is there so much demand for Valkyries on this planet?
Most of it is also old-fashioned.
_0.986
There are a lot of things, but it's because it's used like a private car.
Even if I wanted to go to the neighboring farm, it would take a long time by car.
Also, Valkyrie has limbs, which is convenient.
_0.989
The rest is for self-defense.
Because Bandit has Valkyrie,
I need to have this too.
_0.992
There was also a disturbing planet...
I guess that's why parts are falling all over the place.
_0.995
Aren't all frontier pioneer planets like that?
Ouroboros has many different races aiming to develop new areas.
Maybe it's a little flashy though.
_0.998
Well, thanks to that, I can fly Valkyrie however I want.
That being said, let's think about it positively.
_0.1001
You have arrived at the collection area.
This time, please collect three containers.
_0.1004
roger that.
Let's start work.
_0.1007
Collect the first one.
_0.1010
At this rate, I think I'll be able to do this job easily.
Please finish the rest quickly.
_0.1013
This is my second one.
One more thing and the collection work will be over.
_0.1016
Lion!
There's a plane approaching.
_0.1019
What is this!
There's no more treasure!
_0.1022
The treasure is...
Could it be the bandit that attacked the transport ship?
_0.1025
Hey, what does it matter then?
_0.1028
Can you please shut up, Aisha?
_0.1031
It would have been nice if I had a hunter license...
Well, it's okay, just blow it away!
_0.1034
Understood.
Well then, I'll make you suffer a little.
_0.1037
What is this guy?
It's an old model Valkyrie, and it moves!
_0.1040
It's still too early to complain.
Let me fall like this!
_0.1043
It's not even close to my mouth.
_0.1046
Damn it!
I can't stand being caught in a place like this!
Boss Gunness won't shut up!
_0.1049
Huh, he was Ganeth's henchman. that person….
_0.1052
Who is that Gunness?
_0.1055
You're just an idiot.
Nothing more, nothing less.
_0.1058
That sounds like something you'd say.
_0.1061
I don't care about him.
Instead of that, please continue with your work.
If you can collect one more container, it'll be over.
_0.1064
Okay.
I've been interrupted, but should I continue working?
_0.1067
Container collection is now complete.
_0.1070
Yes, inspection verification OK!
good work!
_0.1073
Well then, please come back to the ship.
_0.1076
Here it is! Don't slack off!
There are still containers left!
_0.1079
Yes, work, work!
_0.1082
This is the first time I've seen you fight, and you're really good.
It looked pretty cool.
_0.1085
Thank you for your compliment.
But...when Aisha praises me normally,
What makes you feel anxious?
_0.1088
Lion-kun, hey!
I got embarrassed because I was praised by a beautiful older sister,
So cute~ ♪
_0.1091
………………Sigh.
Siegfried 1 will now return home.
_0.1094
Yes, the restoration of the VF-0 is now complete.
Now you can transform into a fighter!
_0.1097
Thank you!
_0.1100
But it's amazing.
Restoring a variable fighter aircraft is not something that can be done easily.
_0.1103
Even with this, I was called a doctoral collector at university.
Is it okay to respect me?
_0.1106
It is difficult to say whether to respect him or not, considering his personality, but
She is truly a genius girl.
_0.1109
I feel like right now,
I feel like something terrible was said to me...
Well, that's fine.
_0.1112
Rather than that, Rion!
They called me a genius girl,
That's a big mistake!
_0.1115
Don't be so humble.
Even among Sephira's engineers, there aren't many with this level of skill.
_0.1118
That's not true.
I'm not a genius girl, I'm a genius "beautiful" girl! !
_0.1121
...If you say it yourself, I won't take care of you.
_0.1124
Leon, it's work.
_0.1127
roger that.
Which container should I go pick up this time?
_0.1130
…If you really want to move containers,
I don't really care, okay?
_0.1133
Well, that's a joke.
So, where are you going?
_0.1136
Today, I want you to go and take the hunter exam.
_0.1139
Are you talking about the license you mentioned earlier?
There must be some troublesome laws and regulations, right?
Give up on your days full of studying.
_0.1142
All right.
If you have a certain military background or work history with a private military provider;
You will be exempt from taking the paper test.
_0.1145
That one was saved.
Well then, take the exam quickly.
Would you like to receive a license?
_0.1148
The location is the Hunter's Guild in Daoren City.
When I leave the ship, I'll project the coordinates on the map.
I'll come with you, so don't worry.
_0.1151
Then I'll ask you to navigate me, Aisha.
_0.1154
No! ?
VF-19E “Excalibur”! ?
Did you have something like that?
_0.1157
Hmm.
S. M. S Ouroboros branch, currently the only operating machine.
It's a special specification that uses a lot of custom-made parts.
_0.1160
If you have something like that, I wish you could lend it to me...!
_0.1163
Branch manager privilege!
Moving it will cost you a lot of money.
Hey, hey, if you have something to complain about, please catch up.
_0.1166
Don't be rude!
_0.1169
Hehe, this is the difference in ability between you and me!
_0.1172
No, it's probably the difference in aircraft performance!
_0.1175
It's nice to be able to transform into a fighter.
Riding it feels completely different.
_0.1178
If you can make me that happy,
It was worth the effort to repair this one too.
_0.1181
That being said, the operating system is different.
I should explain how to control the fighter, right?
_0.1184
Oh, I'm sorry, but please.
_0.1187
Well then, I'll start explaining the operation of ``Fighter mode''.
_0.1190
During the explanation, the flight mode will change to normal flight.
Please be careful.
_0.1195
To transform into fighter form, use the direction keys.
Press down on the directional keys to return to Battroid form.
_0.1198
To transform into fighter form, press the left stick.
Press down on the left stick to return to Battroid form.
_0.1201
Fighter mode on the direction key.
Gerwalk form with left and right arrow keys.
It transforms into Battroid form under the direction keys.
_0.1204
If you don't do anything in fighter form
I'm going to fly towards the nose.
_0.1207
Lower the nose on the left stick to descend,
Raise the nose under the left stick and climb.
_0.1210
Lower the nose on the direction key to descend,
Raise the nose under the direction key and climb.
_0.1213
This operation can be reversed in the options, so
Please set the operation settings that suit you.
_0.1216
Boost by holding down the × button.
I can increase my speed and fly.
Be careful as you will be using the boost gauge.
_0.1219
□Roll with the button.
If you press the left stick at the same time, it will roll in that direction.
_0.1222
Hold down the △ button to brake.
If you press the △ button twice quickly, it will reverse jet and suddenly decelerate.
_0.1225
If you press the L3 button while locked on in fighter mode,
Turn around and track the enemy so that it's right in front of you.
_0.1228
Oh, this one is so convenient!
_0.1231
If you press the L3 button again or input the left stick
Tracking mode will be canceled.
_0.1234
In fighter mode, you can't do melee attacks or precision shooting, so
Be careful.
_0.1237
Other basic operations are the same as in Battroid form.
_0.1240
These are the basic operations for fighter mode.
Would you like to hear it again?
_0.1243
Sorry, could you please explain it to me again?
_0.1246
Well, let me explain it again.
Listen carefully this time.
_0.1249
Should be fine!
_0.1252
This concludes the explanation of how to operate the fighter.
Now, let's head to the city of Daoren.
_0.1255
roger that!
_0.1258
No, there's no problem with no explanation.
I'll cover this with experience.
_0.1261
As expected.
Now, let's head to the city of Daoren.
_0.1264
a little bit! That's not it!
Check the map carefully!
_0.1267
Then, "Fighter form/Operation type A"
I'll start explaining.
_0.1270
Then, "Fighter form/Operation type B"
I'll start explaining.
_0.1273
Then, "Fighter form/Operation type C"
I'll start explaining.
_0.1276
In other words, press fighter mode on the direction key.
Gerwalk form with left and right arrow keys.
It transforms into battroid form under the direction keys.
_0.1279
In other words, on the left stick is fighter mode.
Gerwalk mode by pressing left/right of the left stick.
It transforms into Battroid form under the left stick.
_0.1282
Raise the nose on the left stick and ascend,
Lower the nose under the left stick to descend.
_0.1285
If you press the direction key twice in the same direction quickly,
I'll roll in that direction.
_0.1288
If you hold down the R1 button while locked on in fighter mode,
Turn around and track the enemy so that it's right in front of you.
_0.1291
When you release the R1 button, tracking mode will be canceled.
_0.1294
This is the Hunter's Guild.
A little procedure is required...
_0.1297
Arya?
Aisha comes directly to the Hunter's Guild, Nante, and Desune.
_0.1300
Leeron! ?
Why are you here?
_0.1303
Desuyo is helping out here for a bit.
Is Aisha the Desuka who came here?
_0.1306
Actually, I came here to get my license.
But it helped!
If Leeron is there, the process will be easy.
_0.1309
license?
Are you talking nonsense? Aisha already has a license.
_0.1312
No, no.
This is what I came to get.
_0.1315
Things are getting complicated with Aisha.
This is Rion Sakaki.
_0.1318
Sodeska. I am Mei Lilong.
I'm the representative of Britai City's Hunter Guild.
Nice to meet you, Desyo.
_0.1321
Thank you very much for your help.
_0.1324
Aisha's introduction Desdakara,
I don't think it's a problem, but it's already been decided that I'll have to take the test.
_0.1327
Even though it's a test, it's not difficult at all.
In the test field that we are going to specify,
All you have to do is eliminate obstacles and collect items.
_0.1330
hindrance?
_0.1333
There is an examiner here.
If you get shot, you'll get hurt,
Arimas is like destroying your Valkyrie.
_0.1336
Otherwise, it won't be a good test.
_0.1339
Dakara, where a licensed hunter will accompany you as a navigator.
Should I introduce someone from Desca?
_0.1342
I'll go.
It doesn't really matter if it's a relative, right?
_0.1345
Of course death.
The coordinates of the test field are the specified Dakara,
Good luck Kudasaine.
_0.1348
This exam is
He has the ability to make Valkyrie fly.
I mean, prove it.
_0.1351
Well, it feels like that.
Now, let's go to the designated cave.
_0.1354
This looks like an exam venue.
_0.1357
I heard it was a cave, but it's just a strange rock.
_0.1360
Come to think of it, this was my first time at Leon.
This is Fold Stone.
If you touch it, you can move to a specific location.
_0.1363
Hey, that's convenient.
_0.1366
I believe that Rion will pass with ease!
_0.1369
I have to live up to Aisha's expectations.
Shall we go then?
_0.1372
It's a pretty big cave.
If this is the case, there will be no problem if you proceed with Valkyrie,
Is it okay to do it in a place like this?
_0.1375
There are so many things like this on this planet.
Don't worry, it won't collapse even if you blow with all your might.
_0.1378
Originally, the variable fighter was used inside the Zentraedi's huge battleship.
It was intended for combat, so I guess it's suitable for a place like this.
_0.1381
Such that.
Well then, let's go inside.
_0.1384
Is that the examiner Leeron was talking about?
In that case, feel free to let me down!
_0.1387
Now that's cleared up.
I would have liked it to be more chewy.
_0.1390
The exam isn't over yet.
It's a test until you get the item.
Don't let your guard down.
_0.1393
I understand.
Let's go to the deepest part.
_0.1396
It seems like there's more to this planet than just caves.
_0.1399
Hehehe, I understand, Leon.
In fact, many ruins of prehistoric civilizations have been found.
_0.1402
In order to investigate, I
I came to Ouroboros, and S. M. It's not S's business,
There's a limit when you're alone.
_0.1405
Excavation of ruins?
It looks interesting, can I help you?
_0.1408
eh! TRUE! ?
I've never had anyone say that to me before, so that's helpful!
I need to think of a plan as soon as I get back!
_0.1411
I'm indebted to you, and I'll cooperate with you.
_0.1414
Okay, this is the item you're looking for.
_0.1417
Well, the exam is now over.
Let's go back!
_0.1420
Death confirms the test results.
Aisha, Desne found a very good person.
The result was a complete success.
_0.1423
This is Nardesu for the license.
_0.1426
Now I'm a hunter too.
_0.1429
This planet is still young.
Various threats threaten people now.
Our job is to solve that problem.
_0.1432
Thank you for your continued support, Shimasu Death.
Lion-chan!
_0.1435
Ri, Rion-chan...
Well, it's okay, I'll take care of you. Leeron.
_0.1438
So, Deska, do you have any last questions?
_0.1441
...That's right.
There's one thing I'm curious about, okay?
_0.1444
What desca?
_0.1447
You're the representative of Britai City's guild, right?
Aisha also works as a branch manager,
Is it normal for young people to hold positions on this planet?
_0.1450
Ah, that's not right, Leon.
Leeron is just trying to be young for no reason.
Actually, she's an old lady. Oh ba sa n.
_0.1453
Oh, old man! ?
_0.1456
Rion...Aisha is saying something that I don't understand.
You don't have to worry about it, Descara.
_0.1459
I only get nourishment from my chest,
It's like he's speaking in a language that humans don't understand.
_0.1462
What!
_0.1465
Oh no, you'll tell me.
If you're an old lady. Ahahahahahaha.
_0.1468
Desuka doesn't even understand jokes?
This wasted breasted woman. Uhuhuhuhuhu.
_0.1471
...I also received the license.
I'll go back to the ship first.
_0.1474
Ahahahahahaha.
_0.1477
Uhuhuhuhuhu.
_0.1480
Ahahahahahaha.
Uhuhuhuhuhu.
_0.1483
When I talked to Leeron, he said whatever he wanted...
Remember this next time we meet...!
_0.1486
Well, leaving that aside,
Congratulations on passing the hunter exam! Lion!
_0.1489
Ah, thank you.
_0.1492
Now you can work harder than ever!
_0.1495
I guess that's it after all...
Well, please help me.
_0.1498
Well, I also got my hunter license,
Shall we go on a flight date and explain about this planet?
_0.1501
I don't think it's necessary to call it a date, but
I agree with flying.
_0.1504
Let's go then.
...on a flight date!
_0.1507
Why do you emphasize the date part so much?
_0.1510
Don't go too far,
Let's fly around this archipelago.
_0.1515
I was curious,
S. M. For S, the Hunter Guild is
Won't that mean you're a business enemy who will lose your job?
_0.1518
That's different.
It's true that we're colleagues, but
If anything, I'm a good customer.
_0.1521
Even if you call yourself a hunter, you still have to work as an individual.
There's a limit. If such a troublesome job
If you come to the Hunter Guild...
_0.1524
S. from the Hunter Guild. M. So it was requested by S.
_0.1527
Such that.
Thanks to you, I get regular work.
It's a big help for me.
_0.1530
I see.
I'm glad it doesn't seem like I'll eat too much.
_0.1533
By the way, the AI of the YF-25 that I carried was...
What did you order it for?
_0.1536
I'm currently using it on an aircraft I'm currently developing.
I think I'll be able to do a test flight soon.
There's still a problem with the power system, and the output is unstable.
_0.1539
It wouldn't be a bad idea to have you as a test pilot.
_0.1542
Okay, I'm looking forward to that one.
_0.1545
I forgot to mention it, but
If you find a bandit riding a rare aircraft,
Catch as many as you can.
_0.1548
to show off your aircraft
Even coming all the way to a remote planet like this makes me feel bad.
They're eccentric criminals.
_0.1551
Those guys are annoying.
All right, if I find you, I'll punish you.
_0.1554
Well, I am someone other than Gefion.
S. M. I've never been to the S Ouroboros branch,
Where is it?
_0.1557
The ship you are sleeping on is your base,
It's the headquarters of Ouroboros.
_0.1560
Hey, I guess that ship is the headquarters...
_0.1563
There are facilities for storing materials in other areas, though.
In this ouroboros,
It's more convenient to have a branch office where you can move freely.
_0.1566
Is this branch really okay?
_0.1569
This is good because it's convenient.
_0.1572
Well, the fun date is almost over.
I'm sorry to leave you behind, but let's go back to my home.
_0.1575
The sky is nice after all.
I felt refreshed by flying.
_0.1578
Ah, Leon belongs to the group of airplane idiots.
Normally, I would have flown with such a beautiful girl.
Isn't that impressive?
_0.1581
Hey hey, that was bad.
_0.1584
If such an attitude is taken,
I thought maybe I wasn't attractive.
As expected, I'm a little disappointed...
_0.1587
…Ah, what….
It's not that Aisha isn't attractive.
The face and the style...
_0.1590
What what?
What is the continuation of “both face and style”?
What are you trying to say?
_0.1593
...Sigh.
I think she's attractive on the outside, but her personality is a little...
_0.1596
What! I want to say that I have an ugly personality!
It’s terrible, it’s too terrible…!
_0.1599
Starting tomorrow, Lion's side dishes will be
I'll just have pineapple salad!
_0.1602
Sigh….
If only those things could be fixed...
_0.1605
Aisha~!
There's some kind of communication.
_0.1608
From whom?
_0.1611
Oh, Aisha?
_0.1614
Leeron, we're talking about work.
_0.1617
Yes, that's right.
In fact, Zentran is rampaging in the abandoned mine at point Y34.
_0.1620
Zentran is rampaging?
What's that?
_0.1623
I don't know the cause yet.
Dakara, even if it's a little rough, please seize me.
_0.1626
It doesn't seem like it's a job I'm too excited about, but...
I got it. Lion is good too, right?
_0.1629
Ah, no problem.
_0.1632
Well then, I'll send you the location of the abandoned mine.
If you aim for the base of the big tree, you will die right away.
_0.1635
Okay, leave it to me.
_0.1638
Suppressing the Zentran riot...
_0.1641
You can leave this job to me.
Even if it's not lethal, pointing a weapon at your fellow human beings is...
It doesn't feel good.
_0.1644
You don't have to worry about it.
On the contrary, it's because we're compatriots that I have to stop them.
_0.1647
Really….
_0.1650
Now, let's go quickly to avoid any damage.
_0.1653
That's right, then let's fly!
_0.1656
The coordinates that Leeron mentioned are definitely here.
_0.1659
Yeah.
Let's put down the riot before it causes any more damage.
_0.1662
Ah, then let's go inside.
_0.1667
What happened to Aisha?
_0.1670
It's nothing.
I just felt a little confused...
_0.1673
Hey hey, are you okay?
_0.1676
Oh, I can't believe you're so worried.
Are you that worried about your sister?
_0.1679
...I can afford to make fun of it, so it looks like it's okay.
_0.1682
Oh, boring reaction.
It would be cuter if she was a little more flustered.
_0.1685
Hey hey, it's too bad it wasn't cute.
_0.1688
……yeah?
Is there anyone there?
_0.1691
Looks like the Zentorans running rampant here.
_0.1694
Yuck! Yak Zentran,
Gadras! Guardrath! Wow!
_0.1697
Aisha, do you know what I'm saying?
...Well, I can understand the gist of it even if I don't listen to it.
_0.1700
I think that's the correct answer.
I'll try to persuade you a little.
_0.1703
Holt Udana?
Zarg Mertran de-Gadrascas.
_0.1706
Theaishasta Zentran, Gadralaskas!
_0.1709
...Do I need a translation?
_0.1712
No, I don't need it.
First of all, I need you to calm down,
I understand.
_0.1715
If possible, I would have liked to resolve it through discussion...!
_0.1718
That doesn't seem to be the case.
Old man, let's get some sleep!
_0.1721
Tsk, I just killed one person.
The riots will never stop...!
_0.1724
It can't be helped, let's get everyone to sleep for once.
_0.1727
Well, everyone finally fell asleep.
I might have gone a little too far.
_0.1730
The Zentraedi are sturdy, so you'll be fine.
I'm a Zentran, so there's no doubt about it.
_0.1733
Are there many Zentran like this on this planet?
Are you having trouble getting along with Earth's humans?
_0.1736
Well, there are certainly some “stray” Zentraedi,
I'm having a lot of trouble with that, but
These people are ordinary miners.
_0.1739
There was an old man I saw last time I came to work.
There's no doubt about it.
_0.1742
...My head hurts...
that? where is here? Are you...?
_0.1745
I thought you guys were acting wild.
It's a hunter who came to suppress it.
_0.1748
S-suppress! ?
What on earth was going on with us going wild?
_0.1751
Hey, uncle,
Do you remember why you did this?
_0.1754
No, it's refreshing.
_0.1757
We were hired to conduct a preliminary investigation of newly discovered ruins.
So I dug deep into the ruins...
I wonder what happened after that?
_0.1760
on second thoughts…,
This is a cave connected to the ruins.
_0.1763
The thing you said when you left was,
Are you talking about those ruins?
_0.1766
Yeah. Prehistoric civilization, perhaps protoculture
Ruins said to have been left behind.
Could it be that the cause of this riot is the ruins...?
_0.1769
Hey, are you going to be a detective this time?
_0.1772
For now, I'm thinking of being a space archaeologist.
Well, I'll leave the investigation for later.
For now, I have to contact the guild about the uncles.
_0.1775
That's right, I heard the story,
It doesn't seem like that's their intention.
_0.1778
uncle.
I'll explain the situation to the Hunter Guild properly,
I think it probably won't matter.
_0.1781
I think people will come soon,
Please rest here.
_0.1784
Sorry, I'll show my gratitude.
_0.1787
The mission is complete.
Well then, let's pull it up.
_0.1790
It's like......
The Zentran people were rampaging,
It wasn't like they were acting violently of their own volition.
_0.1793
I understand.
_0.1796
Dakara, your testimonies are also consistent.
Since he was in a state of insanity, I didn't think it would be a serious crime.
_0.1799
Yeah, that one was good.
Well, if you need anything else, let me know.
_0.1802
I understand.
Dakara is busy preparing for work, and I'm looking forward to it.
_0.1805
Hmm, I'm definitely curious.
_0.1808
Are you curious about the ruins?
_0.1811
Well, this is just my own speculation, but
I think the Zentoran's rampage may have something to do with the ruins.
_0.1814
The reason is?
_0.1817
There have also been reports of incidents caused by Zentran going out of control.
And those people who ran away...
_0.1820
Does that mean he was someone who had some experience with the ruins?
_0.1823
Such that.
And above all, my intuition tells me that's the case!
_0.1826
That's a statement you wouldn't expect from a genius girl...
_0.1829
That's because he's a genius.
When you can no longer trust your intuition,
I can't live as a scholar!
_0.1832
That's why, Rion!
Let's go investigate the ruins!
I've just received an investigation request from the Hunter's Guild.
_0.1835
I have no particular complaints about going to ruins, but
I'll just ask.
Do I have the right to refuse?
_0.1838
There's no way that's the case!
Let's go!
_0.1841
Well, I thought so...
_0.1844
Humph~humph ♪
_0.1847
You're in a good mood, Aisha.
_0.1850
It's not obvious. I'm heading to the ruins now!
If this doesn't excite you, you can't call yourself an archaeologist!
_0.1853
Isn't that what it is?
_0.1856
Ha, I'm looking forward to it.
I wonder what new discoveries will be made this time...
Gufufufu….
_0.1859
Wait, ruins!
All the ruins on this planet belong to me!
_0.1862
Apparently,
It seems to be true that there is a fine line between Nantoka and genius...
_0.1865
What are the newly excavated ruins?
There are other people besides us who are trying to investigate.
Isn't there one there?
_0.1868
Hmm, I'm sure not.
Exploring ruins is quite difficult.
Especially this ouroboros splash.
_0.1871
Hey, is that so?
If so, I was wondering what the investigation method would be and what the share would be.
I was wondering if we could work together on that...
_0.1874
Most people will cooperate well.
But some people try to monopolize the treasures in the ruins.
There are some idiots too.
_0.1877
...What would you do if such an idiot was in the ruins?
_0.1880
That's not decided.
I'll let you go through some pain, but I'll let you go home clean.
_0.1883
Well, I guess that's the case.
When that happens, leave it to me, Aisha.
_0.1886
I hope you'll accompany me on my exploration of the ruins.
Leon is also a nice person.
_0.1889
I don't have the right to veto it, right?
Besides, I said earlier that I would cooperate.
_0.1892
Hehe, I'm really glad you came to Ouroboros.
Thank you very much, Leon.
_0.1895
I'm sorry, but my family will be in charge of these ruins!
_0.1898
Geez!
Gunness Maudler! ?
It's you again!
_0.1901
Do you know each other?
_0.1904
A former hunter with a bad attitude,
He's an idiot with a tag, no different than a ruins vandal.
_0.1907
Don't say it, Aisha.
Well, the woman who will become my wife has to be that strong-willed!
_0.1910
Aisha, you...
It's better to choose a man wisely...
_0.1913
Stupid!
He's just saying it on his own!
I absolutely hate that guy! !
_0.1916
Heh, okay.
It's a shame, but it's a huge ruin that's deserted.
There's no chance for you guys to appear!
_0.1919
Does that mean you have no intention of cooperating?
_0.1922
It's so hot!
With this Ouroboros, do it your way.
Living is justice! !
_0.1925
If I'm good,
I don't know anything about other people!
_0.1928
Don't worry about others and look at stupid people,
That's what big idiots do!
I'm actually dying from people like that! !
_0.1931
! !
_0.1934
What, are you saying something selfish? Gunness!
You're causing so much trouble to people like that...
_0.1937
Maybe what you say is right...
_0.1940
Lion! ?
_0.1943
Well, you're very understanding, aren't you?
_0.1946
But... Mia's way of life was rejected,
I can't just stay silent...
_0.1949
...Mia?
_0.1952
I have no complaints about your way of life...
But I can't forgive you for making fun of Mia's way of life!
Warii, you will be destroyed! !
_0.1955
You're going to knock me down! ?
You got carried away...!
Come on! Collar! !
_0.1958
Eh, what happened all of a sudden...Rion! ?
_0.1961
What the hell is this guy?
I can't believe he's so strong...!
_0.1964
It's so noisy! Fall down quickly! !
_0.1967
Guaaaaah...!
Shit, shit, what an arm...!
_0.1970
Tsk...pull up, you bastards!
Remember!
_0.1973
...Whew.
_0.1976
It helped me get rid of Gunness.
...So, are you okay too?
It's a little silly, but it seems like things were heating up.
_0.1979
…sorry.
It's okay now...
_0.1982
yes….
I won't ask you why. Please talk to me next time you feel like it.
_0.1985
I'm sorry...
_0.1988
Then Gunness is no more,
Let's enter the ruins.
_0.1991
Ahh.
_0.1994
Mia...I still don't care about you...
_0.1997
Is this cave's size man-made after all?
_0.2000
Many of the ruins in Ouroboros are
Protoculture, the first life form in the galaxy
It is speculated that the ruins are related.
_0.2003
Well, most of them are buildings and non-moving equipment, but
Even so, we are able to form an industry just by digging it out.
_0.2006
If there is something amazing like this,
It wouldn't be strange if people from all over the galaxy gathered here.
_0.2009
People are still gathering, but the fold fault is too thick.
I can't make a proper route.
_0.2012
Also, there's another reason,
It would be faster if you could see the actual item.
_0.2015
In kind?
_0.2018
Well, it's fun to watch.
_0.2021
Hey!
What is that? ?
_0.2024
That's another reason!
_0.2027
The reason is...
Hey, he shot me! ?
_0.2030
These guys themselves aren't worth much!
It's just a weapon to protect the ruins.
_0.2033
Does that mean it's okay to destroy it?
_0.2036
No problem!
_0.2039
Alright, let's go!
_0.2042
So, what was that weapon?
_0.2045
Also known as the "guardian weapon".
In the ruins investigation report,
It is written with the name "Diyaus".
_0.2048
They're usually in and around the ruins of this planet.
_0.2051
A self-propagating metal life form,
It is a watchdog that dutifully protects the ruins even after its master, the civilization, has perished.
_0.2054
I see, there are such disturbing people out there.
It can't even be called a sightseeing tour of the ruins.
_0.2057
Such that.
The ruins are still there. Let's go inside.
_0.2060
They keep coming up one after another!
_0.2063
Well, it's helpful too.
Having a protective weapon means that
That means there are living ruins around there.
_0.2066
Most of the ruins are weathered, so it's a shame,
Folded quartz and interstellar republic era technology.
If you can get it right, you can play with it for a living.
_0.2069
That's a nice dream.
But first, let's deal with the reality in front of us.
_0.2072
That's right. It's not easy to dream.
_0.2075
However, these ruins are truly amazing.
I can kind of understand why the guardian weapon is protecting me.
_0.2078
Therefore, bandits aiming to rob ruins,
People like Gunness won't disappear.
_0.2081
As for those customers,
What about arms exporters and mega corporations?
_0.2084
Such that.
Understood well, right?
_0.2087
Don't be stupid.
At my previous job, I dealt with people like that endlessly.
_0.2090
Before?
S. M. You mean before S?
_0.2093
...My previous workplace is my previous workplace.
_0.2096
Yes, yes.
I'll listen to you whenever you want to say it.
_0.2099
It’s huge!
It's different from the previous types!
_0.2102
What is this...
I can't believe this size exists!
_0.2105
I have no choice but to shoot it down!
Let's go, Aisha!
_0.2110
Hey, Aisha!
_0.2113
Gufufufu!
This is a new discovery of the ruins! !
_0.2116
If we can catch this guy and investigate,
I'm sure you'll learn a lot!
_0.2119
...Aisha branch manager.
I'm sorry you're tripping, but can I get permission to shoot it down?
_0.2122
…………Kohon.
Allow shooting down.
But don't hurt it too much.
_0.2125
Hey hey, wow. Wow.
Please don't get your hopes up.
_0.2128
I believe that you can do it...
_0.2131
You probably know what will happen if you wreck it! !
_0.2134
Well, no matter how things turn out, I'm in a pinch...
Siegfried 1 begins interception!
_0.2137
Okay, Leon.
At that rate, don't damage the guardian weapon too much,
Stop it from functioning!
_0.2140
He makes impossible problems easy.
For now, I'll just do what I can.
_0.2143
Alright!
It looks like you were able to stop the function.
Now all I have to do is collect this thing...
_0.2146
hang on!
The reactor of the guardian weapon is going out of control...!
this is……! !
_0.2149
Self-destruct! ?
Dangerous! Lion!
_0.2152
…Rion! Lion!
Wake up, Rion!
_0.2155
...Ugh, hey, this is Siegfried 1.
_0.2158
Good, it looks like you're okay.
_0.2161
So, where is this?
_0.2164
It's like you just fell underground.
Is there a way to get back up from there?
_0.2167
No, I don't feel like looking around.
I'll look for it a little.
_0.2170
So, could you please explain what you mean?
Lieutenant Leon Sakaki.
_0.2173
I explained it to you earlier.
Because of the protection weapon, he falls underground and finds a girl sleeping there...
The ruins started to collapse, so I brought the child back.
_0.2176
...That's it.
_0.2179
That's all you need!
_0.2182
It can't be helped because it's true! !
_0.2185
I was worried about this too!
I won't be able to contact you, and the ruins will collapse...
_0.2188
...I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry for making you worry, Aisha...
_0.2191
...And that large guardian weapon will self-destruct!
That was a great discovery!
I wish they had at least gotten the parts! !
_0.2194
...I see, that's the punch line.
_0.2197
...I was really worried, you idiot...
_0.2200
Did you say something, Aisha?
_0.2203
It's nothing!
_0.2206
So, about this child,
Is it true that he was sleeping in the ruins?
_0.2209
Ah, it was in an exaggerated capsule.
_0.2212
Hmm...hmm...
_0.2215
Oh, Sleeping Beauty is waking up.
_0.2218
Hey, what do you mean you were sleeping in the ruins?
Maybe you're from Protoculture...! !
_0.2221
eh! What...?
And here...?
_0.2224
Aisha, calm down.
This child has just woken up.
And wouldn't it be rude not to mention your name?
_0.2227
...That's right. That's right.
Sorry, I'll calm down a bit.
_0.2230
My name is Aisha Blanchett.
Sorry for surprising you so soon after you woke up.
_0.2233
I'm Rion Sakaki.
May I ask your name?
_0.2236
It's Mina...
...My name is Mina Forte.
_0.2239
Mina?
Isn't that a nice name?
_0.2242
Oh, thank you very much….
Well, sorry about that.
Where is this?
_0.2245
This is inside our ship.
You were unconscious and I couldn't leave you alone.
I brought him here.
_0.2248
Oh, is that so?
Sorry for the inconvenience...
_0.2251
Please don't worry about it.
Well, I have something I'd like to ask you as well.
Is that okay?
_0.2254
Yes, yes.
I don't mind that, but
There's just one more thing I'd like to ask you first...
_0.2257
Hmm, what?
_0.2260
Well, it's not like I'm joking or anything.
Even if I try to remember, I can't remember at all.
I would like to ask you something...
_0.2263
...In the first place...that...
_0.2266
Who am I...?
_0.2269
eh!
_0.2274
Hey, Aisha.
This could be...
_0.2277
Well, even if it's not...
_0.2280
It's about memory loss...
_0.2283
Phew, hands up.
_0.2286
Head scans, electroencephalogram tests, psychological tests...
No matter what I try, the cause seems to be unknown.
Test results alone indicate a healthy body.
_0.2289
So the story goes that the person in question doesn't remember anything.
There's nothing I can do.
_0.2292
I-I'm sorry...
_0.2295
There's no need for Mina to apologize.
It's not your fault.
_0.2298
...So, that's it.
Hey Aisha...
I have a few questions to ask...
_0.2301
I understand.
This Ouroboros has a better understanding of archeology than I do,
I am proud that there is no humane person.
_0.2304
I don't feel like handing it over to someone else and thinking about it.
_0.2307
...He speaks quickly and is helpful.
_0.2310
Mina, you don't have any memories...
You don't remember your family or your past, do you?
_0.2313
yes….
I can't remember at all...
_0.2316
You don't even remember why you were sleeping in the ruins, right?
_0.2319
yes.
Why am I in such a place...?
_0.2322
Okay, then it's decided!
_0.2325
Hey, Mina.
Would you like to live here with us?
_0.2328
eh?
Is that ok?
It's very helpful to me, but...
_0.2331
Aisha says it’s good.
There's no need to hold back.
_0.2334
but…….
That's it!
Well then, let me help you with your work!
_0.2337
Can you help me?
You don't have to force me to work, okay?
_0.2340
No, that can't be true!
Please work hard and help us!
_0.2343
Hmm, that's right... It seems that Mina's intentions are firm,
Well then, S. M. S Ouroboros branch
I will hire you as an apprentice employee!
_0.2346
thank you! Aisha!
I'll work as hard as I can,
Thank you for your continued support!
_0.2349
Yeah, that's a good answer.
I'd like the guy who joined me on a temporary basis the other day to learn from me.
_0.2352
Hey hey.
_0.2355
Now, we have welcomed Mina as an employee,
Shall we go out right away?
_0.2358
go out? Where?
_0.2361
Shopping, shopping!
Girls need a lot of things.
_0.2364
Of course, Rion will be his escort...
Please come with me as a luggage carrier!
_0.2367
...The main thing is to carry luggage, right?
_0.2370
Thank you very much! Mr. Lion!
_0.2373
This is... Valkyrie...!
Wow, it's really flying in the sky!
_0.2376
If it's Mina, we'll have a lot of fun.
_0.2379
That's right.
But apparently Mina...
It seems unlikely that he was a pilot.
_0.2382
Oh, why?
_0.2385
If you're a pilot, even if you lose your memory, your soul will remember you.
I'm sure if you ride a Valkyrie,
I'm sure my memory will come back in one shot.
_0.2388
Yes, yes.
This is why I'm an airplane idiot...
_0.2391
Hehehe.
_0.2394
I wonder why Mina lost her memory?
_0.2397
sorry, I do not understand….
I've really caused you both trouble...
_0.2400
Well, don't worry about it.
Just be patient and remember.
_0.2403
As for me,
I would be grateful if you could remind me of this sooner, but...
_0.2406
...Hey, Aisha.
I don't think so, but
You wouldn't do any human experiments on Mina, right?
_0.2409
Well, of course I won't!
There is such a thing as benevolence among researchers!
_0.2412
……………….
Don't worry, Mina, I'll help you if something happens.
_0.2415
Ha, yes!
thank you!
Mr. Lion! !
_0.2418
Oh, no!
Oh, I believe it!
Aisha! !
_0.2421
Sigh….
Man, I don't trust you...
_0.2424
Amazing...everything inside this ship is a town!
_0.2427
The ship when humans first landed on this planet.
SDFN-8 “General Britai Kridanik”.
It has become a city.
_0.2430
Wow, that's amazing.
_0.2433
Well, let's start with that shop!
Shopping is war! Must buy for deculture!
_0.2436
Ha, yes!
Please wait, Aisha-san! !
_0.2439
Sigh, that's so sad.
This is why I don't want to accompany a woman shopping.
_0.2442
Come to think of it, shopping with Mia was also like this.
I always have to carry my luggage, and it takes a lot of time...
_0.2445
...Rion-san, Rion-san!
What happened to you being dazed?
_0.2448
yeah?
Oh Mina?
Have you finished shopping?
_0.2451
yes.
But I still want to see Aisha.
I was shouting, ``My real battle is about to begin!''
_0.2454
…Really.
That guy's shopping trip seems to be taking a long time.
_0.2457
Ah, the song...
_0.2460
yeah?
Are you interested in Sheryl Nome's songs?
_0.2463
Is your name Cheryl?
This guy's melody is amazing.
My heart is pounding!
_0.2466
Oh, Cheryl is great.
I liked my sister and friend, so I used to listen to it a lot.
_0.2469
Look, Lyon.
There's something that girls say is nice.
You know what to do, right?
_0.2472
What happened when I thought I was finally back?
Well... okay?
_0.2475
Mina, Cheryl's disc is fine, right?
_0.2478
Oh, no, but it's not that bad!
I've already bought a lot of them...
_0.2481
Let me give you a present to celebrate your joining the company.
_0.2484
Congratulations on joining the company, Mina.
_0.2487
thank you!
I will treasure this disc! !
_0.2490
Don't do it, Rion!
This will increase Mina's likeability!
_0.2493
Noisy!
_0.2496
! !
Lay down, Mina, Aisha!
_0.2499
……What happened! ?
So, Valkyrie! ?
_0.2502
What? Bandit?! ?
The City Police's Destroid Squad... can't be trusted!
It can't be helped!
_0.2505
This is closer to the airport!
Wait until you leave the city before engaging in battle!
_0.2508
Understood!
_0.2511
Eh...Rion-san, are you going to fight?
_0.2514
I can't leave it like this!
I'll be back!
_0.2517
I won't let you escape!
Get off the aircraft and surrender now!
_0.2520
Woooooooooooo! !
_0.2523
Well, there's no need to ask questions.
If that's the case, I'll make you suffer a little pain.
_0.2526
I think it's better to stop here, right?
_0.2529
Ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ! !
_0.2532
Maybe this one is the same as before...?
_0.2535
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ! !
_0.2538
All I have to do now is turn this guy over to the City Police and it'll be resolved.
_0.2541
...Tsuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!
What the hell? My whole body is gone!
_0.2544
Alright, I'll ask you to stay quiet until the police arrive.
_0.2547
police! ?
The bank robbery plan has already been discovered!
_0.2550
Huh?
What did you say?
Didn't you just steal money from the bank?
_0.2553
It is a such a fool!
Why the hell am I...?
_0.2556
What does this mean?
After all, he was also brainwashed...?
_0.2559
Well, even if that was the case, it was planned to be carried out.
I guess he will reflect in prison.
_0.2562
That's the solution. Shall we return to the ship?
_0.2565
Siegfried 1 completes landing.
_0.2568
Mr. Lion!
welcome back! !
_0.2571
Welcome home, Leon.
_0.2574
Hey, I'm home. Mina, Aisha.
_0.2577
Rion-san came back safely,
It was really good!
_0.2580
I was impressed.
I think it's amazing that you can do something for people!
_0.2583
It's not amazing.
It's just that this is the only thing I can do.
_0.2586
No, that's not true!
Leon is amazing! !
_0.2589
…Thank you, Mina.
_0.2592
However, please stop calling Rion "Mr.".
My whole body feels itchy.
_0.2595
``Rion'' is fine.
_0.2598
Yeah, but...
_0.2601
Just because Rion says it's good doesn't mean it's good.
Of course, I can also be Aisha.
_0.2604
Oh, I understand.
Rion...Aisha...
_0.2607
Yes, well done.
_0.2610
Okay, so it's Mina's welcome party and celebration for joining the company.
Shall we do it today?
_0.2613
Hehe, that's good.
Well then, let's eat something delicious! !
_0.2616
Ou!
Other than pine salad!
_0.2619
Oh, oh! !
_0.2622
Rion, can I have a moment?
I have a job that I would like you to do.
_0.2625
No problem.
What should I do?
_0.2628
Actually, there are some ruins that I've been curious about for a while.
We might find clues about Mina's memory,
I want you to join me as I explore.
_0.2631
S. M. Although it doesn't mean that it's S's job,
I'll take some money out of my pocket money.
_0.2634
I don't need that.
This is branch official hobby time, right?
When you're ready, let's leave right away.
_0.2637
Ah, that!
_0.2640
yeah?
What's wrong, Mina?
_0.2643
Well, I'd like to go with you too...
_0.2646
That's right. It might have something to do with Mina's memories,
I think it would be better if you came with me.
Then Mina will be with Rion...
_0.2649
I want to pilot a Valkyrie!
_0.2654
I am also S. M. I am an employee of the S Ouroboros branch,
I want to be able to help Lion and the others!
_0.2657
Mina...The spirit of challenge is important, but
As expected, having someone pilot a Valkyrie without any practice...
_0.2660
Yes, Mina.
This is something you should practice properly on a simulator.
Otherwise it's dangerous.
_0.2663
I-I see...
I was wondering if I could help you two...
_0.2666
This kid is really healthy...
Would you like to become our child?
Hey, dad.
_0.2669
Who's the daddy?
_0.2672
Hehe, joking aside,
When I get back, I'll teach you how to fly properly. Mina.
_0.2675
really! ?
_0.2678
Really true.
Well then, let's head to the ruins.
_0.2681
Yes!
_0.2684
By the way, I forgot to check,
Do you have permission to excavate?
_0.2687
......Tehe.
_0.2690
I thought...
I understand why you say it's a personal request.
_0.2693
The government's guard on this matter is strangely tight.
That's why I'm a little silly
I thought I'd let you investigate.
_0.2696
There's also something about Mina.
There's nothing wrong with doing research.
_0.2699
Apparently it's near here...
_0.2702
Leon, it looks like that.
_0.2705
Now, I hope you understand something.
You won't know what's going to happen until you go.
_0.2708
Such that. Well, let's go.
_0.2711
It looks like the excavation of this ruins is almost complete.
_0.2714
Did Mina remember anything?
_0.2717
Sorry, nothing...
But it feels kind of nostalgic...
_0.2720
That being said, it doesn't seem to be off the mark.
Let's go inside.
_0.2723
Looking at it again, it's amazing.
Are there ruins like this all over this planet?
_0.2726
What we understand about Ouroboros is
I'd say there aren't many.
It may take several thousand years or more to complete the investigation of this planet.
_0.2729
It's a story on a huge scale.
Well, let's investigate this ruins properly.
_0.2732
Aisha, can I ask you something?
_0.2735
Hmm, what?
_0.2738
You said you were a space archaeologist.
Why are you majoring in space archeology?
_0.2741
I'm a Zentraedi, so like you humans,
Almost no history of ethnic groups or tribes remains.
_0.2744
So if I continue doing space archaeology, I'll be able to find records of Zentraedi battles.
You may also learn about cultures other than combat.
I...I want to find our history.
_0.2747
Is that one of Aisha's dreams?
The history of the Zentraedi. The scale is huge.
_0.2750
Yeah, so I know it's hard.
Still, I want to make this dream come true...
_0.2753
Aisha is thinking and living for her dreams.
_0.2756
Maybe you're making fun of me?
_0.2759
No way.
I just ride a Valkyrie and fly through the sky...
That's all I continue to do even now.
_0.2762
Compared to me, the more you think about it, the bigger you are.
I think it's a good thing to be proud of.
_0.2765
That's right!
It's important to think about your goals.
That's why I think Aisha is admirable!
_0.2768
...Hehe, thank you.
Leon, Mina.
_0.2771
Is this the final destination?
I hope there's some clue about Mina's memory...
_0.2774
……wait a minute.
There are signs that people were there.
_0.2777
Apparently most of the things here are
Looks like they took it with them.
_0.2780
It's not like the ghost of protoculture brought this up, right?
_0.2783
Such that.
Looks like I wasted my time coming here.
_0.2786
It can't be helped, I have no choice but to go back.
Is that okay for Mina too?
_0.2791
Hey, Mina.
Did something happen?
_0.2796
What happened to you, Mina...?
_0.2799
Start up the ruins...song?
_0.2802
Mina! ?
Damn it!
What on earth is going on? ?
_0.2805
There's no way you'll understand!
This is what I want to know! !
_0.2808
Mina! Are you okay! ?
_0.2811
Rion, Aisha...
_0.2814
Is there something wrong?
You're not hurt, right?
_0.2817
No, it's okay...
_0.2820
Mina... What the hell was going on?
_0.2823
I...I remembered.
_0.2826
Do you remember?
...Mina, do you really remember?
_0.2829
Me...I...!
_0.2832
...For now, let's go back to the ship.
There's no need to talk about it here.
_0.2835
Yeah, that's right. Okay, Mina?
_0.2838
…yes.
_0.2843
Mina....
_0.2846
I'm glad you came back from the ruins safely.
in…….
_0.2849
Mina, can you tell me what you remember?
_0.2852
yes….
_0.2855
I don't remember everything.
It's a little bit, but what I need to do...
_0.2858
what to do?
_0.2861
What is happening on this planet Ouroboros...
_0.2864
Abnormal occurrence of ouroboros aurora,
The Zentraedi go on a rampage,
It seems like the ruins are the cause...
_0.2867
I guess that's what happened after all.
I was directly involved in two cases, but from what I heard from the guild,
It seems like similar incidents are occurring frequently.
_0.2870
I...I will make sure that the ruins do not malfunction.
Even while I was sleeping, I had to calm it down in my dreams.
_0.2873
! ?
_0.2878
That's why I was sleeping in those ruins.
All the time to prevent the ruins from going out of control...
_0.2881
This is me...
It's just part of the ruins system...
_0.2888
I… who am I? ?
An existence meant to pacify the ruins...!
why! Why is that...!
_0.2891
If this is the case...
If something like this happened, I shouldn't have gotten my memories back!
_0.2894
Rion and Aisha,
As long as the three of us can have fun together...
That was all I needed! !
_0.2899
...I can do it. We will continue to have days like this.
_0.2902
There's no way you can!
What am I?
Even if they suddenly tell me to pacify the ruins...!
_0.2905
Even if your existence is such a big deal,
Mina is Mina! !
_0.2908
Leon...but...
_0.2911
You are S. M. I'm an employee of the S Ouroboros branch.
Then we're no longer like family.
_0.2914
Family, huh?
_0.2917
our precious family.
That's what Mina is to me.
_0.2920
That's what happened.
So you should just live your life as usual.
_0.2923
Is it really okay?
Rion... Aisha...?
_0.2926
Of course it's fine.
_0.2929
Of course not.
_0.2932
thank you….
What can I say...
_0.2935
Hiccup…. Ugh...
_0.2938
Look, I won't cry anymore, I won't cry anymore.
_0.2941
I-I'm sorry....
_0.2944
I'll do my best.
In order to quell this abnormality of Ouroboros.
_0.2947
I want to protect this planet where Rion and Aisha are!
_0.2950
Mina...
_0.2953
Wow, Mina is a really good girl.
After all, he really is our child...
_0.2956
It's the second time today, so I'm going to talk about that topic.
_0.2959
Hehehe.
It was really nice to meet you both!
Thank you for your continued support. Lion, Aisha!
_0.2962
Nice to meet you, Mina!
_0.2965
Nice to meet you, Mina!
_0.2968
Hey, Mina.
_0.2971
yeah?
Is there something you need from Mina?
_0.2974
Ah, I'm thinking of flying over there for a bit.
I was wondering if Mina would come with me too.
_0.2977
...Yeah, even if I say it's okay.
It's not like I'm not shocked.
Maybe I should change my mind.
_0.2980
What's the matter with you, Leon is such a congenial person.
_0.2983
“Kusani” is redundant, “Kusani” is….
_0.2986
Ah, that's right.
In that case, would you mind coming to work while I'm at it?
I've received a request for container collection work.
_0.2989
I'm talking about a change of pace,
I don't think I should let him work...
_0.2992
Next, then.
It also served as Mina's Valkyrie piloting practice.
_0.2995
yeah?
Did you teach Mina how to fly?
_0.2998
The basics are covered in a simulator.
That kid learned things incredibly fast.
_0.3001
Isn't that amazing?
_0.3004
At that level, I don't think it would be a problem to ride a real machine.
Just in case, I will assist you remotely.
Let's take a flight together.
_0.3007
Understood.
Well then, should I invite Mina to go?
_0.3010
Wow!
After all, the view looks different from the view from the back seat!
_0.3013
Hehehe.
I was so happy.
I'm glad I let you pilot it.
_0.3016
That's right.
_0.3019
If something happens, please protect Mina.
_0.3022
of course.
_0.3025
Well then, Rion, Mina.
Take care of yourself and goodbye.
_0.3028
I'm coming. Aisha.
_0.3031
What is that Mina guy?
You can operate it without any problem.
_0.3034
This is also because Aisha accompanied me in the pilot training.
Thank you, Aisha.
_0.3037
Hehe, I haven't done anything worthy of a thank you.
Keep up the good work, Mina.
_0.3040
Yes! I will do my best!
_0.3043
Well, it's about time.
I'll explain the advanced version of Valkyrie control.
_0.3046
thank you!
Teacher Aisha!
_0.3049
Yeah, that's a good answer.
_0.3052
What will Leon do?
You can listen to the explanation with Mina,
I don't mind if you help me teach.
_0.3055
That's right.
May I take Aisha-sensei's special lecture?
_0.3058
Well then, let's start explaining ``Advanced operations''.
_0.3061
First, let me explain about anti-missile action.
_0.3064
Anti-missile action?
_0.3067
Action to nullify enemy missiles,
It's called anti-missile action.
_0.3070
Being targeted by enemy missiles
A missile marker will appear on the screen.
_0.3073
When that missile marker turns red,
If you hold down the L2 button and press the R2 button,
Can shoot down enemy missiles.
_0.3076
When that missile marker turns red,
If you press the ○ button while holding down the L2 button,
Can shoot down enemy missiles.
_0.3079
When that missile marker turns red,
If you hold down the X button and press the □ button,
Can shoot down enemy missiles.
_0.3082
Battroid form and Gerwalk form are shooting attacks,
In fighter form and some aircraft,
Shoot flares and drop enemy missiles.
_0.3085
During anti-missile action,
Be careful as it will consume your anti-missile gauge.
_0.3088
anti-missile action,
This is a maneuver you absolutely must learn to avoid missiles.
Remember that, Mina.
_0.3091
It's a very important operation.
got it. I'll do my best to remember!
_0.3094
Next, let me explain about "Charge Action".
_0.3097
If you press the ○ button while holding down the L2 button,
I'll use up one block of SP gauge to fire a charge shot.
_0.3100
If you press the ○ button while holding down the R2 button,
I'll use up one block of SP gauge to fire a charge shot.
_0.3103
If you press the ○ button while holding down the L1 button,
I'll use up one block of SP gauge to fire a charge shot.
_0.3106
If you hold down the L2 button and press the △ button,
It consumes 1 block of SP gauge to boost the charge.
_0.3109
If you hold down the L1 button and press the △ button,
It consumes 1 block of SP gauge to boost the charge.
_0.3112
I see. When you want to approach a target at high speed,
Effective when you want to deal great damage to the enemy.
…and. Memo memo.
_0.3115
By pressing the △ and ○ buttons at the same time,
Consumes 3 blocks of SP gauge,
You can perform powerful special attacks!
_0.3118
It's what you would call a special move.
Depending on how you use the special attack,
The war situation will change dramatically.
_0.3121
Use it every time the SP gauge accumulates,
You need to decide whether to save it and use it in a pinch.
_0.3124
Hmm, I'm worried.
_0.3127
If there are more wingmen,
If you hold down the R2 button and press the △ and ○ buttons at the same time,
You can combine special attacks with your wingman!
_0.3130
If there are more wingmen,
If you hold down the L1 button and press the △ and ○ buttons at the same time,
You can combine special attacks with your wingman!
_0.3133
The amount of SP gauge consumed is 3 blocks, which is the same as when alone.
It is better to use a special attack with two people than to use it with one person.
It's definitely a good deal. Let's use it proactively!
_0.3136
yes!
_0.3139
That's a good reply.
Okay, next, I'll explain about ``command skills''.
_0.3142
By pressing the ○ and × buttons at the same time,
You can use the command skills of support characters.
_0.3145
By supporting characters
The effects of command skills will change.
_0.3148
As a supporter myself,
I can help you with your work.
_0.3151
That's right.
I look forward to your continued support, Mina.
_0.3154
yes!
I will do my best!
_0.3157
The explanation will continue.
Next, I'll explain about ``wingman instructions''.
_0.3160
If you press the direction key after pressing the SELECT button,
I can give instructions to the first wingman.
_0.3163
When you want to give instructions to the second wingman,
After pressing the SELECT button
Please press the ○ button, × button, △ button, and □ button.
_0.3166
Press the arrow key up or the △ button to perform normal actions.
Use the left arrow key or the □ button to gather.
_0.3169
Use the command skill by pressing the right arrow key or the ○ button.
Use the down direction key or the × button to perform a special attack.
I can give you instructions.
_0.3172
I think I will be giving instructions a lot,
To make your work as easy as possible,
I'll do my best to give you appropriate instructions.
_0.3175
Please don't embarrass me by giving me unreasonable instructions.
_0.3178
Well then, finally, I'll explain about ``rescue''.
_0.3181
If a wingman becomes incapacitated,
If you get close to the aircraft, you can recover your wingman's incapacity.
But be careful, you can't rescue him in fighter form.
_0.3184
It means you can get help.
_0.3187
There are no restrictions, so you can rescue people as many times as you like.
If your wingman gets killed, please help him.
_0.3190
You'll need items to rescue them.
If you don't have it, you won't be able to rescue them, so be careful.
_0.3193
This concludes the explanation of the advanced operation method.
Do I need to explain it again?
_0.3196
I think you should listen to it again.
_0.3199
Yes, please try again.
_0.3202
I got it.
Well, let me explain it again.
_0.3205
Mina, did you understand?
_0.3208
Yes, it is okay!
thank you very much. Teacher Aisha.
It was very easy to understand.
_0.3211
Yeah, I'm glad I asked too.
_0.3214
This completes the explanation.
_0.3217
thank you very much. Teacher Aisha.
It was very easy to understand.
_0.3222
That's right.
Me too with Aisha
May I play the role of Mina's teacher?
_0.3225
Then, the two of us will teach you thoroughly.
Are you ready, Mina?
_0.3228
Yes!
Thank you for your support.
Teacher Aisha! Mr. Leon!
_0.3233
thank you very much.
Aisha Sensei, Rion Sensei.
It was very easy to understand.
_0.3236
Hehe, thank you.
_0.3239
I will continue to practice piloting and do my best!
_0.3242
Yes, Mina.
There is no easy way to learn how to control a vehicle.
It's important to practice steadily.
_0.3247
I can now control this much.
There doesn't seem to be any problem with this job,
Shall I just go to work?
_0.3250
That's right.
I'm doing some other work, so
I left the rest to you.
_0.3253
Well, Mina, let's head to the collection area.
_0.3256
Then, "Advanced operation/operation type A"
I'll start explaining.
_0.3259
Then, "Advanced operation/operation type B"
I'll start explaining.
_0.3262
Then, "Advanced operation/operation type C"
I'll start explaining.
_0.3265
When that missile marker turns red,
If you hold down the R2 button and press the □ button,
Can shoot down enemy missiles.
_0.3268
When that missile marker turns red,
If you hold down the L2 button and press the □ button,
Can shoot down enemy missiles.
_0.3271
If you hold down the L2 button and press the R2 button,
I'll use up one block of SP gauge to fire a charge shot.
_0.3274
If you hold down the R2 button and press the △ button,
I'll use up one block of SP gauge and do a charge fight.
_0.3277
If you hold down the L2 button and press the △ button,
I'll use up one block of SP gauge and do a charge fight.
_0.3280
If you hold down the L1 button and press the △ button,
I'll use up one block of SP gauge and do a charge fight.
_0.3283
If you hold down the R2 button and press the × button,
It consumes 1 block of SP gauge to boost the charge.
_0.3286
If you hold down the L2 button and press the × button,
It consumes 1 block of SP gauge to boost the charge.
_0.3289
If you hold down the L1 button and press the × button,
It consumes 1 block of SP gauge to boost the charge.
_0.3292
If there are more wingmen,
If you hold down the L2 button and press the △ and ○ buttons at the same time,
You can combine special attacks with your wingman!
_0.3297
That's a good reply.
Next, I'll explain about ``Support Skills''.
_0.3300
By pressing the ○ and × buttons at the same time,
You can use the support skills of support characters.
_0.3303
By supporting characters
The effects of support skills will change.
_0.3306
Use the support skill by pressing the right arrow key or the ○ button.
Use the down direction key or the × button to perform a special attack.
I can give you instructions.
_0.3309
This is the collection area.
It's my first job, so I'm nervous.
_0.3312
I'll follow you properly,
I hope Mina can fly without straining her shoulders.
Well then, let's get to work.
_0.3315
Mina can understand our words and letters, right?
Does that mean they use the same language?
However, it's not like I could read the writing on the ruins.
_0.3318
Hmm, what is it?
_0.3321
If my memory returns, I wonder if I'll be able to understand things around here.
Let's continue working for now.
_0.3324
This is my second one.
...Hehe.
_0.3327
What happened? Mina?
_0.3330
No, the two people picked up by Aisha
The situation where I was picking things up was a little strange...
_0.3333
Haha, that's true too.
_0.3336
I really have to thank Aisha.
Let's work hard for that purpose.
_0.3339
Is that... Vajra?
Why are you on Ouroboros?
_0.3342
What is Vajra?
_0.3345
Well, Mina doesn't know.
Vajra is a creature that is connected by fold waves.
_0.3348
To support the frontier fleet
We once fought, but suddenly it disappeared.
...I never expected to meet you in a place like this...
_0.3351
From that creature called Vajra,
I don't feel any hostility, but...?
_0.3354
It's true that they won't launch an attack.
Mina is there too, so it seems better to avoid battle.
_0.3357
Now there's only one left.
_0.3360
That's right, Mina's first job will be completed soon.
_0.3363
Yes!
I'll do my best not to let my guard down until the end!
_0.3366
The collection is now complete.
Thank you for your hard work, Leon.
_0.3369
Mina is also tired.
I guess I'll go home soon then.
_0.3372
Welcome back, both of you.
_0.3375
I'm home, Aisha.
_0.3378
It seems like you did the job perfectly,
Thanks.
_0.3381
No, I was also glad that I was able to chat with Leon a lot.
_0.3384
Oh, what did you talk about?
_0.3387
that's a secret.
Hey? Lion.
_0.3390
Oh, that's right.
Well then, let's make a meal out of it.
_0.3395
eh? eh?
Maybe I'm the only outcast?
_0.3398
I see.
If you deal with it like this,
You can respond smoothly.
_0.3401
That's what happened.
Mina is a quick learner, so it's worth teaching her.
_0.3404
That's how good...Rion's teaching style is.
_0.3407
You two.
I'm sorry for the nice atmosphere, but I'll ask Leeron for a request.
Please come to the bridge.
_0.3410
What kind of work do you do?
_0.3413
I do not know?
Let's go.
_0.3416
Vajra appears at point X61! Death!
There are no developed areas in that area, so there is no damage caused by Deathga...
_0.3419
No damage caused?
Then why are you in such a hurry?
_0.3422
In fact, there is a Valkyrie protecting Vajra.
Desukedo has no intention of using shock bullets to kill us.
_0.3425
Are humans protecting Vajra?
_0.3428
Moreover, the Valkyrie who protects Vajra,
VF-25 “Messiah” Desyo.
_0.3431
Radical conservation groups own and protect Vajra.
It's hard to imagine that.
_0.3434
Only a limited number of new joint forces are using that,
S. M. It should only be S's elite troops...
_0.3437
IFF is S. M. This is from the S Frontier branch.
Dakara's opponent was also quite skilled, and the army temporarily retreated.
Lion, I asked for Aisha.
_0.3440
The knight who protects Vajra, right?
There are all kinds of people on this planet.
_0.3443
I wonder what I would do if I were a wonderful knight! ?
And that is a forbidden love that will never end...
_0.3446
...For now, I'll prepare to sortie.
Let's go, Mina.
_0.3449
Eh, ah, yes...
_0.3452
Well, I think the through line is terrible...
_0.3455
Did you see Vajra the other day?
_0.3458
Ah, so I guess I have no choice but to fight Vajra after all...
_0.3461
I know that the Frontier fleet was engaged, but
There isn't that much information on this planet.
The ouroboros aurora was occurring at that time.
_0.3464
I have fought Vajra before,
In the end, the battle ended without me really understanding anything.
I don't know the details.
_0.3467
There's not enough information.
Let's hurry to the scene.
_0.3470
I'm also curious about Vajra, though.
What I'm more concerned about is the Knight of Vajra.
_0.3473
surely.
I don't even know why they're protecting Vajra.
_0.3476
Maybe you love Vajra?
_0.3479
It would be best to ask the person himself about that.
Let's go.
_0.3482
We will soon arrive at the destination mentioned in the report.
_0.3485
understood.
Don't let your guard down.
_0.3488
Siegfried 1!
Engage with Vajra!
_0.3491
It seems that there are no knights.
_0.3494
For now, the first thing to do is annihilate Vajra.
Siegfried 1 begins the battle.
_0.3497
Shoot down one Vajra!
Let me do it like this!
_0.3500
This is the last one!
_0.3503
Lion!
I saw an aircraft approaching rapidly!
_0.3506
Apparently, the rumored knight has appeared.
_0.3509
That's it!
I won't let Vajra mess with me any more!
_0.3512
This... protecting Vajra and Sheryl is...
It's the only thing I can do right now!
_0.3515
This is S. M. This is Lieutenant Leon Sakaki from S!
Since we work in the same company, would you like to talk calmly?
_0.3518
S. M. I don't care if it's S or what.
You can't trust people on this planet!
...Cheryl, let's fly a little flashy.
_0.3521
Is alto okay?
I get such a bad feeling from those people...
_0.3524
Even if we talk about it, it's only after it's incapacitated.
Skull 4 begins the battle!
_0.3527
Tsk, it looks like I have no choice but to do it.
_0.3530
As expected, S. M. Something like S.
A skilled pilot will be on board!
_0.3533
But here too,
I can't just let them do it quietly!
_0.3536
Damn it!
He's on a different level than the guys I've fought before!
_0.3539
Hey, Alto!
After all, those people...
_0.3542
That's why I can't let it continue like this! !
_0.3545
Hey, let me tell you a little bit about me... Kyaah!
_0.3548
eh! No way...
Cheryl...?
_0.3551
That's real, right?
_0.3554
Are you serious…….
_0.3557
Cheryl...?
_0.3560
Really...
Please listen to me for a moment, Alto.
_0.3563
There is no intention of fighting here.
Why don't we talk calmly on the ship for once?
_0.3566
Alto?
_0.3569
...That's right, let me do that.
_0.3572
Well, this is how I set up a calm seat.
Can you please explain some things to me?
_0.3575
Ah, I see.
But before that, let me introduce myself.
_0.3578
I'm S. M. S Frontier Branch,
This is Second Lieutenant Alto Saotome, a member of the Skull Platoon.
_0.3581
And this one...
There's no need to introduce it though, right?
_0.3584
As might be expected,
You can't say you don't know Sheryl Nome.
_0.3587
even if that were true,
Let me properly introduce myself.
_0.3590
My name is Sheryl Nome.
People on the street call her the Galactic Fairy.
_0.3593
Cheryl is right in front of me...
_0.3596
Mina, I feel bad for being so happy, but let's move on.
Right off the bat, why were you protecting Vajra?
_0.3599
Vajra is not an enemy of humanity.
Cheryl and I know that.
_0.3602
So those who try to exterminate Vajra,
Does that mean you were fighting them off?
_0.3605
Ahh. But that's not all.
Shoot an implant into Vajra,
There were also people who tried to manipulate me.
_0.3608
An implant is a machine that is placed inside the body.
It seems like this technology is commonplace in the Galaxy, but...
_0.3611
Are there such disturbing people on this planet?
Aisha, do you have any idea?
_0.3614
I honestly don't know.
_0.3617
Vajra, whom I fought a long time ago,
Does that mean he was controlled by an implant?
_0.3620
I understand why they are protecting Vajra.
And to me, you guys are Vajra.
It seemed like they were communicating well?
_0.3623
Sing. I can't talk about the details, but
Communication with Vajra in my song
Do you have the power to take it?
_0.3626
Such amazing power...
_0.3629
I don't know if they are aiming for that power, but
In fact, Cheryl was almost sent to a machine of unknown affiliation.
There were times when I was almost kidnapped.
_0.3632
Then, to protect Cheryl,
I was working with Vajra and the others.
_0.3635
He said he couldn't trust the people on this planet.
Was it because of that reason?
_0.3638
I also have a question.
What mission did you come to Ouroboros on?
I don't think there's a mission that doesn't come through me.
_0.3641
I mean, it's a mission...actually, I don't know that.
When I defolded it, it felt like I was on this planet.
_0.3644
Defold?
Is this something recent?
This planet should be closed off by a fold fault right now, right?
_0.3647
Me and Cheryl
For some reason, my memory of what happened before I folded is vague.
_0.3650
When I woke up, I was on this planet with Alto.
I don't know, but it's near some ruins.
Suddenly from the frontier fleet.
_0.3653
got it.
For now, Alto and the others don't really understand.
I knew exactly what I was getting into.
_0.3656
So, what to do next...
_0.3659
That's right. I had fun camping with Alto, but
I want to sleep in a proper bed soon.
S. M. If it's S, I'd like to be troublesome by being an escort.
_0.3662
I'll ask you too.
Looks like I can trust you guys.
_0.3665
As a branch manager, I have no complaints.
Isn't Cheryl's bodyguard nice?
There are plenty of rooms in Gefion.
_0.3668
Well then, I'll ask for your help from now on.
Alto, Sheryl.
_0.3671
Ah, please take care of me.
_0.3674
I'll take care of you.
_0.3677
Wow, I can't wait to spend time with Sheryl.
It's like a dream...!
_0.3680
Speaking of which,
I was concerned because the IFF signal is old.
The current time on the aircraft was 2059.
_0.3683
No matter how much there is a time difference due to the fold fault,
There will be a gap of one year from 2060.
I can't think of anything...
_0.3686
2060! ?
Don't be stupid!
It must be 2059 now!
_0.3689
Hey, Sheryl, what are you kidding me about?
_0.3692
What kind of a joke is that?
At least, the year was 2059 just before I came to this planet.
That's absolutely true.
_0.3695
...Hey, Aisha.
What the hell is going on?
_0.3698
It seems like a phenomenon similar to space-time folding,
General fold theory alone is enough...
_0.3701
...And even more so, it looks like I'll have no choice but to cause trouble for you guys.
The situation is too unclear.
_0.3704
That's right.
Due to the influence of ouroboros aurora,
S. M. I can't even contact the S Frontier branch.
_0.3707
Ha, I'm sure what's really going on.
_0.3712
Come to think of it, you are also S. M. Are you member S?
_0.3715
Ha, yes!
Well...I'm a big fan of Cheryl...
May I ask you to shake my hand?
_0.3718
Hehe, that's a request from such a cute girl.
It's good to be motivated.
_0.3721
thank you! !
_0.3724
eh?
_0.3727
What is this? ?
_0.3730
This guy…,
It's the same as when Mina remembered her memories before...!
_0.3733
Maybe Sheryl has something to do with the ruins! ?
_0.3736
Are you okay! Cheryl!
_0.3739
Eh, eh... But what exactly...?
_0.3742
Aisha, this guy could be...
_0.3745
Yes, that's definitely the case!
_0.3748
Cheryl and others
It's said that it was near the ruins when it was defolded.
It has something to do with the ruins! !
_0.3751
What the hell is going on?
Please explain it to us as well!
_0.3754
Sorry, Leon.
Please explain to Cheryl and the others.
I'm going to the ruins first and investigating!
_0.3757
Hey, wait, Aisha!
_0.3760
...It looks like he's already gone.
_0.3763
It can't be helped.
Aisha's gone, so I have no choice but to explain.
actually…….
_0.3766
That's what happened on this planet.
_0.3769
Mina, who has something to do with the ruins, and Cheryl, who reacted to it.
There seems to be some kind of relationship between the two.
_0.3772
That's very likely.
Aisha also flew straight to the ruins.
_0.3775
Maybe we should go too?
Not only the planet's abnormality, but also the space-time fold.
It seems possible that it was influenced by the ruins.
_0.3778
That's right.
Well then, let's head to the ruins right away.
_0.3781
Let's head to the ruins!
Are you ready? Alto?
_0.3784
No problem, but why are you in charge?
_0.3787
That's not decided.
Because I'm Sheryl Nome!
_0.3790
She looks like a queen, just like the rumors say.
_0.3793
wonderful! Sheryl!
_0.3796
Please don't be a bad influence on Mina, Sheryl...
_0.3799
After all, Aisha was also in trouble.
When it comes to ruins, he immediately goes out of control.
_0.3802
Hehe, that's certainly true.
_0.3805
So that we can quickly meet up at the ruins,
Wouldn't it be better to contact you?
_0.3808
That's right.
_0.3811
that? That's strange.
It seems that communication is not possible.
_0.3814
A powerful jamming wave is coming out near the ruins?
_0.3817
...I'm worried about Aisha. Hurry up!
_0.3820
This is the ruins where Cheryl and I defolded.
Please be careful. I haven't entered anything other than near the entrance.
_0.3823
roger that.
First, let's find Aisha and join her.
I'm concerned that communications are down.
_0.3826
That's right.
Basically, follow Leon and Siegfried 1's instructions.
_0.3829
Understood. Skull 4.
_0.3832
Looks like Aisha hasn't come back yet.
Does that mean it's still in the ruins?
_0.3835
Lion!
Let's go to the ruins right away!
I'm going to keep Sheryl Nome waiting! ?
_0.3838
Hey hey. I'll go now, so please wait a moment.
_0.3841
It seems that Vajra and his friends have left this ruins.
When you work with Cheryl,
It seems like he understands that it's too much for people to see.
_0.3844
You can really talk to Vajra.
_0.3847
I'm not able to communicate properly either.
We can only communicate our feelings through songs.
_0.3850
I think it would be amazing if we could do that.
Now, let's go inside.
_0.3853
After all, there are traces of someone having visited these ruins as well.
_0.3856
They might be the ones who shot the implant into Vajra.
Don't let your guard down, Leon.
_0.3859
Power reaction...!
This sound is Valkyrie!
_0.3862
Who the heck could be in these ruins?
_0.3865
Shooting without warning! ?
What on earth were you thinking?!
It can't be helped. Skull 4, let's intercept!
_0.3868
Understood!
Siegfried 1!
_0.3871
These guys!
Well trained!
_0.3874
No way, these guys are military! ?
_0.3877
That's after it's over.
We have to do something about these guys first!
_0.3880
Damn it! Let me escape! !
_0.3883
Stop it, Alto.
It's too close to call. Pursuing deeper than this is dangerous.
_0.3886
...Damn!
_0.3889
They're not just bandits or terrorists.
If it's a strategic move, it's troublesome.
_0.3892
For now, let's think about joining up with Aisha.
That's more important than fighting here.
_0.3895
That's right.
There's no point in putting Cheryl and the others in any more danger.
_0.3898
Now let's head to the deepest part of the ruins.
_0.3901
Apparently this is the deepest part of the ruins.
_0.3904
Looks like there's also an Aisha guy.
_0.3907
Ah, it's finally here.
_0.3910
Already, Aisha!
I was worried because I couldn't get in touch with you!
_0.3913
Sorry, sorry.
It wasn't too late anyway. Did something happen?
_0.3916
A group of unknown affiliation is inside the ruins.
I was attacked without any questions asked.
_0.3919
There weren't any of those guys when I came.
I wonder what the purpose was?
_0.3922
I don't really understand the purpose.
I was suddenly attacked and was able to escape immediately.
_0.3925
Hmm, then there's no point worrying about it.
Instead, look! I discovered something like this!
_0.3928
What is this?
_0.3931
I don't know the details, but
It looks like a device that controls the ruins.
If only I knew how to use this...
_0.3934
…singing,…energy, replenishment…?
_0.3937
Mina! Did you find out anything?
_0.3940
Yes, somehow...
Cheryl-san, can I ask you to lend me your strength?
_0.3943
I don't mind being stubborn.
What should I do?
_0.3946
I will link to the ruins from now on.
I would like Cheryl to sing.
_0.3949
sing? Can it be any song?
_0.3952
yes.
...Ah, but I have one request.
_0.3955
Something?
_0.3958
Please sing while thinking of your loved ones.
_0.3961
……I got it. Then let's go! !
Listen to my song! !
_0.3964
(Alto....)
_0.3967
Cheryl's song comes to me...
_0.3970
………………….
_0.3973
I understand Cheryl's feelings.
_0.3976
Energy replenishment to the ruins has been confirmed.
The activation of the ruins here is now complete.
_0.3979
Mina, what about activating the ruins...?
_0.3982
The cause of the abnormal behavior of the ruins.
It was due to lack of energy.
_0.3985
To supplement that energy,
Does that mean you asked Cheryl to sing it?
_0.3988
The energy required to stabilize the ruins.
That's the energy of the song.
For that reason, the ruins called Sheryl and the others to this era...
_0.3991
The ruins are calling us after all!
_0.3994
If so,
From the explanation I just gave, I can understand why Cheryl was called.
But why was I called too?
_0.3997
I'm sure they are calling people who have a strong relationship with the diva together.
_0.4000
What kind of ruins could make such a thing happen...?
_0.4003
Me too, up to that point....
_0.4006
I remembered that I was linked to the ruins,
We need to replenish the ruins with song energy,
_0.4009
There are five other ruins similar to this one.
This means that you need to activate a total of 6 ruins.
_0.4012
Then find a new ruin
Does that mean I should sing again?
_0.4015
No, Sheryl has already activated the ruins here, so
Due to the system, it seems that other ruins cannot be activated anymore.
_0.4018
I wonder why it has such a troublesome structure?
_0.4021
I still don't understand that...
_0.4024
If there are things we don't know, we'll just have to investigate.
However, many things were revealed!
I have to hurry back to the ship and compile the data!
_0.4027
Okay, then let's get back to the ship quickly!
I'll take the lead!
Follow me!
_0.4030
Wait, Aisha.
I know you're excited, but please calm down.
_0.4033
Kyaaaaaaaah! ?
_0.4036
! ?
Aisha!
_0.4039
Did you try to ambush me?
_0.4042
...The output of the thermonuclear burst engine does not increase...! ?
It's bad, if this continues, I'll be targeted...!
_0.4045
Siegfried 1!
We will begin controlling the skies!
I asked you to protect Aisha!
_0.4048
Understood, Skull 4!
If you shoot without marking your nationality,
They'll be treated the same as terrorists and bandits!
_0.4051
sorry!
I'll divert all the output to the energy conversion armor!
I'll be standing on my feet, but I'll cover it up somehow!
_0.4054
It's been a long time!
I will definitely protect you!
_0.4057
I won't let you touch Aisha!
_0.4060
Did the damage exceed the allowable range?
I'm retreating!
_0.4063
Skull 4, complete control of the sky.
There's no sign of reinforcements or long-range missiles.
_0.4066
Ah, well, that was helpful.
I wonder what will happen at the moment...
_0.4069
Geez……!
We just talked about having a trained armed group!
It's too much fun.
_0.4072
...Sorry for worrying you...
_0.4075
Sigh, I don't really care.
As long as it's okay, that's fine.
I won't forgive anyone who hurts you.
_0.4078
Lion...
_0.4081
...Hey, the two of you aren't in a good mood.
I really want to take a shower.
_0.4084
No, I'm not in a good mood!
Well then, let's pull up!
_0.4087
Does this mean that the first ruin has been activated?
However, this doesn't mean the turmoil has subsided yet.
_0.4090
Yes, in order to control the abnormality of Ouroboros,
It seems like it won't work unless the other ruins are activated as well.
_0.4093
And to do that, you need multiple divas.
_0.4096
If I don't replenish my singing energy,
What will happen if I don't activate the ruins?
_0.4099
I feel like something even worse is going to happen...
_0.4102
If you have any more hints, please help with song energy replenishment.
I can understand the cause and effect relationship of abnormal convergence.
_0.4105
Hey.
The one that called me and Aruto was the ruins.
It wouldn't be strange if other divas besides me were also called, right?
_0.4108
Mainly for people with strong singing energy
If I were to call you...
_0.4111
...There's a high possibility that Ranka is coming.
_0.4114
Super Dimension Cinderella, Ranka Lee.
_0.4117
If so,
I think it would be better if I continue to work with you guys.
I would like to lend you my help, is that okay?
_0.4120
of course.
I look forward to your continued support.
_0.4123
Hey, are you okay, Mina?
_0.4126
Yes... it's okay.
...So, you were listening to that more than anything! ?
_0.4129
That was a great song, Mina-chan.
_0.4132
Ah, that's a beautiful song.
_0.4135
Don't worry, I recorded it perfectly.
_0.4138
eh? eh? eh?
_0.4141
Haha, everyone is praising Mina's singing.
_0.4144
Eh, no, uh...
_0.4147
Hehe, it's so cute to be embarrassed.
I have to record Mina like that...
_0.4150
Oh, please stop taking pictures.
_0.4153
I don't care, I don't care.
I thought we weren't there, so I sang it again.
_0.4156
That's impossible.
_0.4159
Ahahahahahaha.
_0.4166
Honestly, back then Mina was so cute when she was talking all over the phone.
I also feel that Aisha wants to take a picture of me.
I kind of understood it.
_0.4169
Leon, are you there?
_0.4172
Hey, Aisha? What happened?
_0.4175
Leeron wants you to come to Britai City as soon as possible.
I'm a little busy, so
Can I ask you a favor?
_0.4178
Ah, no problem.
_0.4181
I haven't heard the details of the request, but
I told you to be fully armed,
I think it will be quite a hard job.
_0.4184
I think it would be better to have Alto come too.
Shall I call out to you? Well then, let's go.
_0.4187
Please come.
_0.4190
Guild work has become more and more strenuous,
We need to improve the aircraft's performance.
_0.4193
That's right. If you can collect the parts,
I'm going to develop it right away.
Then I'm sure your job will become easier.
_0.4196
I'll make sure to collect the parts.
_0.4199
By the way, Mina,
Before, it felt like I was eavesdropping, but
Please let me listen to the song carefully this time.
_0.4202
Eh, ah, yes, that's right....
I want everyone to listen to the song,
There's no point in being shy.
_0.4205
Next time I'll ask you to listen carefully.
Please be prepared, Leon!
_0.4208
Leeron, I heard that you have an urgent request.
_0.4211
Ah, Leon-chan.
In fact, there were many deserters from the New Joint Forces in Desune.
_0.4214
Desuga doesn't know the reason for his escape,
There are also reports that there was internal conflict within the new joint forces.
_0.4217
Are you telling me to come and catch those escapees?
It's true that we need to be fully equipped,
Don't get revenged.
_0.4220
That's right, Deathyo.
The escapees barricaded themselves in an abandoned New Joint Forces base.
Desne calls himself Golden Talon.
_0.4223
Dakara sends base information,
Good luck getting rid of Golden Talon. Lion-chan.
_0.4228
I would like to confirm,
Is it okay to say that I'm a hunter too?
_0.4231
As long as one person has an official license, it's OK.
Aisha wants to be able to leave her work to Lion-chan.
Dakara seems to have gotten a license.
_0.4234
Well then, that's all for the request explanation.
It's a request from Havamar, so do your best!
_0.4237
Havemar?
I've never heard of that name before, but what is it?
_0.4240
It is the core of the Ouroboros Provisional Government.
Death of a unit of the New Joint Forces.
_0.4243
Why would such people ask the Hunter Guild?
_0.4246
When I'm busy, I always get requests for work.
That's okay Descara, Desne is going to work.
_0.4249
Well, no matter who the client is, I'll get the job done.
Well, let's go, Leeron.
_0.4252
A deserter...
Looks like the new unified army on this planet is in a lot of trouble.
_0.4255
Maybe the military's functions aren't working properly.
That's why Hunter Guild and S. M. To S.
I guess the situation is that work comes around.
_0.4258
You came out.
It's a good aircraft, but that alone won't be enough to bring us down.
_0.4261
Let's do it!
_0.4264
I'll knock them all down and make them reflect in prison!
_0.4267
So sweet!
I can't lose to guys who rely on the performance of their aircraft!
_0.4270
Okay, we've confirmed that the enemy plane has been shot down.
Siegfried 1 is about to rush into the enemy's hideout!
_0.4273
Skull 4, support.
Leave the rest to me.
_0.4276
Ou! I'm making fun of it!
Let's break into the base!
_0.4279
The base doesn't look that bad at first glance, but
Why was it scrapped?
_0.4282
Just because a protective weapon appeared from under the base,
I heard it from Leeron.
_0.4285
Is that a biological weapon?
Do you think it has something to do with the runaway ruins?
_0.4288
I can't say that it doesn't exist.
It seems like it's more active than before.
_0.4291
...Well, I'm getting a message on a different line.
I'll cut off communication for a moment.
_0.4296
Well then, let's go deeper.
_0.4299
I've been curious about it for a while now,
Is Alto Yuto Saotome from Ginga Kabuki?
_0.4302
...! ?
Do you know!
_0.4305
Ahh.
My father liked old Japanese performing arts such as Kabuki and Noh.
I remember seeing your play on TV.
_0.4308
I've already stepped off the stage.
I have no connection to Saotome's house.
_0.4311
That one was bad.
I thought it would fly beautifully.
_0.4316
I heard that you were intruding,
What kind of relationship do you have with Sheryl?
_0.4319
When I was flying back to Cheryl's concert,
Vajra attacked us.
I just helped out with that.
_0.4322
...Is that "only"?
_0.4325
...That's right.
He's always honest about his craft,
He's the kind of guy who stands up to his own weaknesses, even if it means spitting blood.
_0.4328
It may not be something I would say after getting off the stage, but
I respect you and consider it important.
_0.4331
I see, that's enough for me to hear.
_0.4334
yeah?
It seems like something has moved, but what happened?
_0.4337
Perhaps a system somewhere far away was activated.
Let's investigate around.
_0.4340
Okay! This is the last one!
_0.4343
There is no response to this sensor either.
The suppression of Golden Talon is now complete.
_0.4346
You said this job was requested by an organization called Havamar.
Wasn't this base originally part of that organization?
_0.4349
Is there any reason to think so?
_0.4352
Even though it was abandoned, it seems like it could still be used.
Isn't it strange that there are still things that would be in trouble if stolen by deserters?
_0.4355
It's a lot more realistic than stories related to ruins.
The mission is complete. Let's go back.
_0.4358
Thank you for your hard work, Death.
Descara was in trouble with Golden Talon,
Now everyone can sleep in peace.
_0.4361
Ou.
If you need anything else, please let me know.
Well then, I'll report the request completion to Aisha.
_0.4364
Aisha! The guild's work is finished.
_0.4367
Ah, Leon.
A customer is coming over right now.
If you've finished your work, please come back.
_0.4370
…customer?
_0.4373
……HM.
I can't go into details at the moment, but
It's at a level where they are somehow making use of the little information they got from the ruins.
_0.4376
Even there, still
That doesn't mean the analysis is perfect.
_0.4379
With some staff viewing this theory as problematic,
After all, it crosses the fold fault between areas.
There are various negative effects, and it is not in a beautiful state.
_0.4382
Spatial understanding related to fold faults
I saw the paper on that control.
It's amazing that it's in the testing stage.
_0.4385
You are the one who deserves those words.
This data is hard to believe that I achieved results in a short period of 3 years alone.
_0.4388
The commander also spent a long time excavating the ruins,
This is because they have prepared a research base for the Yulia Archipelago and the Sierra Desert.
_0.4391
Yeah, it's not something to be humble about.
_0.4394
No, that's not true...
_0.4397
By the way, I hear you're a Zentraedi pureblood?
_0.4400
yes? Is that so?
_0.4403
HM. Interesting…….
_0.4406
Sorry, I seem to have lingered too long.
Please excuse me now.
_0.4409
Aisha, Rion is back.
_0.4412
Ah, sorry for interrupting your conversation!
_0.4415
No, I was just about to excuse myself.
Aisha, who is this child?
_0.4418
My friend's daughter works part-time and studies social studies.
I'm asking for some help with my work.
Mina, this is Commander Todo of the New Joint Forces. Please say hello.
_0.4421
Oh, yes.
Nice to meet you, Commander Todo.
My name is Mina Forte.
_0.4424
...Hmm.
My name is Ushio Todo.
He is the commander of the New Joint Forces Special Forces Havamar.
_0.4427
...Now, Aisha-kun and Mina-kun, please excuse me.
I'm looking forward to the opportunity to exchange information about the ruins.
_0.4430
Commander, I will escort you to the hangar.
_0.4433
No guidance needed.
I can at least know the way to the hangar.
_0.4436
...Whew. I was so nervous.
As expected, there was no way Commander Todo would find out about Mina.
It's not going to work.
_0.4439
eh?
Really?
_0.4442
Commander Todo is also the one investigating the ruins.
I don't think anything terrible will happen, but
It's something you should keep in mind.
_0.4445
Okay, let's go pick up Leon and the others.
_0.4448
Hey, you're kidding...
After all, the plane that crashed me is here!
_0.4451
He's still a noisy guy.
_0.4454
……rod! ?
Why are you here?
_0.4457
Huh...
_0.4460
Hey, stop sighing!
Please explain properly!
_0.4463
There's nothing to talk about with you.
_0.4466
You were the one who killed me in the Ouroboros sector!
I thought it was a move I had seen somewhere before.
_0.4469
Your steering is still rough as usual.
He's a guy who hasn't made any progress...
_0.4472
what!
……yeah?
_0.4475
Captain Rod, let's go home.
_0.4478
Ha!
_0.4481
Hey!
Don't ignore me! rod! !
_0.4484
Is it okay?
_0.4487
No problem.
_0.4490
That bastard...!
_0.4493
I was worried that he was going to punch me in front of Commander Todo.
It was chilled.
_0.4496
Don't do that!
_0.4499
Leon, I'm scared...
_0.4502
Damn it!
...Haha...
_0.4505
Hey Aisha?
_0.4508
What?
_0.4511
Who is that Todo that Rod was accompanying?
_0.4514
I'm the chief executive of the new Joint Forces Special Forces Havamar.
_0.4517
What kind of big guy is that?
_0.4520
Commander Todo is also investigating the ruins.
So let's exchange some information.
_0.4523
Same as here, the chief executive directly...
Does that mean Rod belongs to Havamar?
So for this ouroboros...
_0.4526
They seem like old acquaintances, but what is their relationship?
_0.4529
Close friend…….
The guy who was...
_0.4532
Damn it!
Next time we meet, I'll ask you to explain it properly, Rod!
_0.4535
yeah?
_0.4538
Aisha, are you okay?
_0.4541
Mina isn't there either.
_0.4544
Where did Sheryl and Alto go?
_0.4547
Leon, are you awake?
_0.4550
Oh, where are you?
It seems like everyone is not on the ship?
_0.4553
The four of us are now at Britai City.
Cheryl has something to ask me.
_0.4556
I wish you'd woken me up.
_0.4559
I tried to wake you up.
You just didn't wake up.
I'll be right back when I'm done, so please let me know if you need anything.
_0.4562
Understood.
_0.4565
Huh.
Now, what should I do?
_0.4568
Maybe I'll take a shower and get some sleep...
_0.4571
Hey Death!
Desca with Aisha?
_0.4574
Hey there, Leeron.
Aisha is going to Britai City.
Do you have some work to do?
_0.4577
I have a job that I need urgently!
Des is in a lot of trouble.
Please help me, Lion-chan! !
_0.4580
I just had some free time, so no problem.
_0.4583
Thank you!
The hunter who belongs to us has gone missing!
Dakara has no signs of fighting, and Death believes he's safe...
_0.4586
Please send me the aircraft information.
I'll start searching right away.
_0.4589
Now, where should I start searching?
_0.4592
I'm glad I accepted, but it's quite a hassle.
_0.4595
Where are you going...?
_0.4598
I hope I don't get into any trouble...
_0.4601
Leeron, are there any new clues?
_0.4604
There's nothing special about it.
Good luck, Rion-chan!
_0.4607
It's influenced by ouroboros aurora.
I don't think they have left the Yuria Archipelago...
_0.4610
Wow!
Is there an engine problem at a time like this?
It can't be helped, let's land there sometime.
_0.4613
The heat... Basara...
_0.4616
It's my first time coming to such a rocky planet.
The planet's song makes my heart tremble.
_0.4619
The planet's... song?
_0.4622
What, can't you hear me?
This wind, that aurora, the floating islands,
Everyone sings the chorus!
_0.4625
...That's what it sounds like to you.
As expected of FIRE You mean Basara from BOMBER?
_0.4628
It doesn't matter who I am.
I'm just making sounds into the galaxy.
_0.4631
So you should sing your own songs.
That's all there is to it, right?
_0.4634
...Hey, could you let me listen to one more song?
_0.4637
Oh, let me hear it!
My soul is glaringly hot!
Listen to my song! !
_0.4640
I'm gone....
_0.4643
...Wow!
If it's Basara, activating the ruins is a piece of cake! ?
_0.4646
Well, maybe we'll meet again soon.
I feel like that somehow.
_0.4649
Well, the hunt for hunters has resumed.
_0.4652
Having said that, where did I look for it?
_0.4655
Lion-chan.
Did Desca find any clues?
_0.4658
sorry.
What can be called a clue is refreshing.
_0.4661
Although it is unconfirmed information,
There are also reports that it was shot down by bandits.
_0.4664
I see, I need to find it soon...!
The search will continue.
_0.4667
Please, Suyo.
I'll contact you again if I have any additional information.
_0.4670
yeah?
That aircraft!
_0.4673
Hey, are you okay? !
_0.4676
That saved me! !
I had lost all means of communication and was at a loss.
_0.4679
Hey!
Leeron, can you hear me?
We found the missing hunter!
_0.4682
Is it really death? !
Lion-chan! Thanks Death! ! Thank you very much! !
Desne immediately sends help.
_0.4685
Do I have to take her home?
_0.4688
It's okay, Deathyo!
Death has already sent the emergency services.
Desperate to arrive soon, no problem.
_0.4691
OK.
Hey Leeron,
Since the work is complete, I'll let you go home.
_0.4694
Thank you so much, Leon-chan.
I look forward to working with you in the future, Desyo.
_0.4697
Welcome back, Leon.
_0.4700
Welcome back!
_0.4703
Oh, you were back?
_0.4706
Just a while ago.
Even so, it was bad.
I got the job done by Leeron.
_0.4709
I had some free time.
It was also nice to hear some good songs.
_0.4712
good song?
_0.4715
It's nothing.
How was it there?
Did you mention that Cheryl asked you to do something?
_0.4718
There's no problem with it.
Well, that's a natural result.
_0.4721
It was an instant decision.
That's amazing Sheryl!
_0.4724
After all, you won't tell me what you've been doing.
_0.4727
You'll find out soon.
_0.4730
I hope this reaches Ranka-chan...
_0.4733
I'm sure it will arrive...and I'll see you soon.
_0.4736
Hey, Rion.
I need your help with something, is that okay?
_0.4739
I guess you're finally telling me what you said before.
What should I do?
_0.4742
Actually, it's Buritai City.
I'm thinking of doing a charity concert.
_0.4745
Logistics is cut off by Ouroboros Aurora,
Everyone is feeling anxious, right?
_0.4748
So one thing,
I want to make everyone feel better with my songs.
_0.4751
I see.
That's why I got permission from Britai City.
I can't refuse a request from a galactic fairy.
_0.4754
That's how it is.
_0.4757
I didn't think Alto would agree to this live show.
It's not good that Sheryl stands out too much, right?
_0.4760
...Anyway, Sheryl can't stop herself from becoming like this.
In that case, it would be better to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.
_0.4763
...I don't agree with it, or rather, I feel like I've given up.
_0.4766
I'm also looking forward to Sheryl's live performance.
Let's do our best to help you, Leon.
_0.4769
Mina seems to be on board too.
Shall I try my best?
_0.4772
Let's head to Buritai City right away.
I'll shake the galaxy with my song!
_0.4775
It's a shame that Cheryl's selfishness made me go along with her.
_0.4778
Mina is looking forward to it too.
I'll help you properly.
_0.4781
Now, let's head to Britai City.
_0.4784
It's too late now,
When you who came from the past sing here,
Isn't this going to get complicated?
_0.4787
No problem. Even for me in the future,
I have no right to stop myself from singing now.
I'm a galaxy fairy. Just sing when you want to sing!
_0.4790
I don't think that's the problem...
_0.4793
As expected of Cheryl!
_0.4796
And Mina agrees...
_0.4799
This is the live venue.
It's not that bad.
_0.4802
Setting up with Lion and Alto,
Then please do a show-up with Valkyrie!
_0.4805
So, Sheryl, about today's set list.
I'd like to have a meeting...
_0.4808
Wow, there are so many people. It's amazing!
This is how live performances are held.
_0.4811
Hey, Mina.
Sorry, please help me.
_0.4814
Yes, I understand!
_0.4817
Phew.
For now, the venue preparations are complete.
_0.4820
Yes, now we just have to wait for the show to start!
_0.4823
Leon, this is bad!
The Zentraedi are causing a riot!
_0.4826
Hey, you're kidding.
_0.4829
Apparently, there are people who are inciting a riot.
We can't let them get any closer to the live venue!
_0.4832
leave it to me!
Mina, stay here and protect Sheryl!
_0.4835
picture! ? Ah, yes! I will do my best!
Lion also wants everyone to enjoy the live performance.
Please do your best!
_0.4838
The essence of us Zentraedi is destruction!
Woooooo! Break it! Destroy the culture!
Don't follow the micro clones! Free your soul!
_0.4841
People like that are everywhere...!
_0.4844
Still, these guys are used to fighting.
Be careful, you can get hurt if you don't do it well!
_0.4847
Hey... Debran, you're pretending to be Minmei...!
You guys, follow me!
_0.4850
Whatever the reason,
I can't forgive someone who does this!
Do! Alto!
_0.4853
Ahh!
I won't let you interfere with Sheryl's live performance!
_0.4856
a little bit!
It’s true that there are people who are violent outside the stage! ?
_0.4859
If you want to hear my song that much,
I'll let you hear it to your heart's content!
Listen to my song!
_0.4862
Cheryl...! ?
_0.4865
Oh... that's Cheryl's song!
_0.4868
Awesome!
The Zentraedi were so violent,
I'm hooked on Cheryl's songs!
_0.4871
Okay!
Let's put down the riot at once!
_0.4874
I'm sorry for making you wait, Desune, Rion-chan.
We will also protect the live show! !
_0.4877
Thank you for the reinforcements!
Please, Leeron!
_0.4880
Tsk, it's faster than the Valkyrie in the data!
...Well, I need to report to you!
_0.4883
It looks like they were able to quell the riot somehow...
_0.4886
Sorry for the delay in coming to help you, Desitades.
_0.4889
This is how we were able to protect the city.
Don `t worry.
_0.4892
Thank you. I love you all! !
Thank you everyone!
_0.4895
It looks like the live performance was a success as well.
_0.4898
As expected of Sheryl Nome.
This much trouble is nothing.
_0.4901
That's right.
Well, let's go back too.
_0.4904
Thank you for your hard work, Alto and Rion!
It seems like you worked hard for my live performance.
_0.4907
It seems like your live performance was a great success.
_0.4910
Hehe, that's not natural.
_0.4913
It was my first time to see Cheryl on stage live.
It was amazing... it was really amazing!
_0.4916
Thank you Mina-chan.
But this time, instead of just listening, let's sing along.
_0.4919
eh!
In front of so many people?
That's impossible for me!
_0.4922
Please look forward to it.
_0.4925
eh? eh? Are you serious?
_0.4928
Well, I'm already tired today.
Good night.
_0.4931
Hey, Sheryl! !
_0.4934
Mina also seems to be loved by Cheryl.
That's good.
_0.4937
Isn't that just teasing?
_0.4940
yeah?
Is this song...?
_0.4943
FIRE I can't believe I'm listening to BOMBER's songs.
That's unusual, Mina.
_0.4946
Ah, Leon.
I received my salary from Aisha,
I used that money to buy new discs.
_0.4949
Because Mina is a Cheryl fan,
I thought I was going to buy Sheryl's disc...
_0.4952
I'm so sad, Mina.
Does that mean you're not interested in me anymore?
_0.4955
Cheers, Sheryl! ?
No, that's not true! When I went to the store, the clerk recommended it to me...
Well, that's why...
_0.4958
Hey, Cheryl.
Don't embarrass Mina.
_0.4961
Hehe, Mina-chan is so honest and cute.
I'm glad it's worth teasing you.
_0.4964
Ah!
I was made fun of...
_0.4967
Sorry, Mina-chan.
_0.4970
Cheryl is also FIRE Are you a fan of BOMBER?
_0.4973
It's different from fans...
But as an artist myself, I'm sure I admire him.
_0.4976
Thoughts on vocalist Basara's singing...
I respect the spirit.
_0.4979
I also think this band is amazing!
_0.4982
Well.
It's not just Basara that's amazing, but the female vocals...
_0.4985
Rion, this is an urgent request from the Hunter Guild.
Stray Zentran are attacking the transport ship of Nova Industry!
The closest ones are us!
_0.4988
I've also contacted Alto.
Lion, scramble!
_0.4991
roger that!
Please stay safe until we arrive...!
_0.4994
Alto!
Hurry to the destination!
_0.4997
Ah, I understand!
_0.5000
Following the live show the other day, there will be Zentraedi again.
Is it because of the ruins this time too?
_0.5003
More on the cause later!
Let's hurry to the scene now!
_0.5006
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
This is the transport ship Nocchurunu!
Currently, we are being attacked by the stray Zentraedi...!
_0.5009
Request support!
repeat. This is….
_0.5012
That’s it!
It seems like they're holding out somehow, but the escort planes are wiped out...!
_0.5015
This is Siegfried 1.
I found your ship. From now on, I will assist you!
_0.5018
Siegfried 1, thank you!
This is commissioned by the military to transport reactive weapons!
_0.5021
Reaction weapon! ?
There are so many things!
Start the attack!
_0.5024
More enemy planes are coming!
Please be careful!
_0.5027
Damn, what a number!
Is the purpose to seize the reaction weapon? ?
_0.5030
No one other than the new unified government has reactive weapons.
Because it's lost technology.
_0.5033
If you are a stray Zentran who intends to join the core fleet,
It's only natural to want to get it as a souvenir!
_0.5036
Guys!
Are you planning to steal the entire transport ship? ?
_0.5039
It seems so!
I can't afford to have my reaction bullet taken away...!
_0.5042
yeah?
A battleship is approaching this airspace! ?
_0.5045
This guy...FIRE BOMBER! ?
_0.5048
Why Zentraedi ships?
Are you on my side?
_0.5051
What...! ?
_0.5054
what were we doing?
_0.5057
Okay, you've come back to your senses!
You are controlled by Spiritia,
He was out of control! Do you understand?
_0.5060
Control Spiritia?
_0.5063
That's it. Well, to put it simply, it's brainwashing.
Then this daughter of Miria gave Spiritia with her song,
I was able to regain consciousness.
_0.5066
Although not as good as Basara,
Even I am FIRE It's BOMBER!
_0.5069
Anyway, it was helpful.
Let me thank you. you know…….
_0.5072
It's Kamjin. Kamzin Kravshera.
Commander of the 7th Space Armored Division, belonging to the 109th Branch Fleet.
Commonly known as Kamjin-sama, the ally killer, it's me!
_0.5075
Kamjin?
It's a name I've heard somewhere...
_0.5078
Come on, you bastards!
The chains of brainwashing that bound you have been broken!
It's time to fulfill the essence of Zentraedi!
_0.5081
Let's bite!
We, the Khamjin family, will receive the cargo of reactive bullets!
_0.5084
What! ?
_0.5087
Speaking of Kamjin, after making peace with the Britian fleet,
He's not a terrorist who started a rebellion.
_0.5090
I see, that “Kamjin, the ally killer”!
But if the record is true, he's a terrorist from nearly 50 years ago.
...Does that mean he has also traveled through space and time?
_0.5093
Oh, oh...?
sa! Zarg Zentran!
_0.5096
If the superior says so, I have no objection!
_0.5099
Hey, that's a slightly different topic!
Shouldn't you be talking to the people on this planet? ?
What happened to the strange investigation?
_0.5102
That's why I'm investigating!
This is the Zentraedi way!
Stay back! If you don't, I'll involve you!
_0.5105
...! Those people!
Stop Camjin!
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble!
_0.5108
I'll do it even if you don't tell me!
_0.5111
Well, after one difficult time, it's going to be another difficult time.
I won't let you escape, Kamjin!
_0.5114
It's boring if you don't resist me.
Hey, come on, Micron!
_0.5117
The Zentraedi are a race born to fight!
Those who were tamed by Micron are idiots!
_0.5120
Don't force your ideas on me!
The universe is vast.
Two races can live together! !
_0.5123
If that's the case, I'll try to force your logic through!
Even you, Earth's humans, were created by protoculture.
Maybe it’s Satan Doll, a tool of war!
_0.5126
Humans..., Zentraedi...
I won't do anything with you!
_0.5129
It'll keep you entertained, won't it?
It's okay, it's not bad.
Not bad, dude!
_0.5132
Hey, you battle crazy!
_0.5135
Ha, that seems to be all for today.
I really enjoyed it.
Dudes! I'll pull you up!
_0.5138
Ohhh!
_0.5141
...You bastards...
The stray Zentras followed him.
Is he a man with that kind of charisma...?
_0.5144
Well, I can't pursue it too deeply.
Escorting the transport ship is the top priority.
_0.5147
Hey!
What will happen to me?
It would be terrible to leave it like this!
_0.5150
Following Sheryl Nome,
Does that mean Mylene Genus was also called to the ruins...?
_0.5153
After all, no matter where you look at it
FIRE It's Mylene from BOMBER.
_0.5156
That's why I've been saying that for a while now.
I'm Mylène Genus!
FIRE He is the bassist and vocalist of BOMBER!
_0.5159
Hey Mylène, can I ask you one question?
What year is it now?
_0.5162
Huh?
Yes, there may be a time lag, but
Isn't it 2047 according to Galactic Standard Time?
_0.5165
That was 13 years ago...
_0.5168
Yeah yeah!
What on earth was that 13 years ago? ?
Basically, where is this place? ?
_0.5171
Looks like I need to explain it from scratch.
We don't know when the battleship will explode,
Would you like to come to our ship once?
_0.5174
Hmm, that's right.
It seems like a strange situation,
Right on! Please tell me your story!
_0.5177
...Haha, I see.
So I guess I came 13 years into the future.
_0.5180
Yes, we apologize for the inconvenience.
It seems like the ruins system has called you out.
_0.5183
It seems like something terrible is happening.
So, I don't know how to get back home...I still don't know, right?
_0.5186
For now.
I've been doing some research, but...
_0.5189
The power of ruins is amazing, but
As far as whether the aftercare is good or not...
_0.5192
Uuu. At first, that Kamzin was Zentraedi.
I was wondering if you could help me...
_0.5195
How do you know him?
_0.5198
It was the first time I met him since I came to this era.
I know my mom and dad, Max and Milia.
That's why I thought I'd ask for your help.
_0.5201
...Certainly, Kamzin Kravshera,
It wouldn't be strange if we knew each other.
_0.5204
Max, the captain of Macross 7,
The story of him serving on the SDF-1 during the Interstellar War is well known.
_0.5207
They say my song will stop the Zentraedi from running wild.
Even though I helped him, I never thought he was there to do something like that...
Next time we meet, I won't give it to you for free!
_0.5210
Well, I don't have a place to go back to.
I think I can trust you guys,
It would be helpful if you could take care of me for a little while...
_0.5213
There's no problem with motivation.
S. M. S Ouroboros Branch welcomes you.
_0.5216
Ah, that! Mylene!
Can I hold your hand for a moment?
_0.5219
Okay, but... why?
_0.5222
Sorry, Mylène.
Please shake hands with Mina.
_0.5225
No….
_0.5228
It's just as I thought.
_0.5231
Hey, what's going on?
_0.5234
Let me explain...
_0.5237
...That's why we consider this incident to be a serious incident.
I'm working to solve a problem.
_0.5240
Is the scale of this anomaly planet-scale or larger?
I don't know yet, but considering the fact that I've been calling people from the past.
More than that is likely to happen.
_0.5243
If you research the ruins,
Maybe we can go back to the original era.
That's why we're cooperating with Leon.
_0.5246
To help this ouroboros,
Please lend me your help, Mylène!
please!
_0.5249
That's right.
If there is such a situation,
If you are interested, I will also cooperate!
_0.5252
Thank you, Mylene.
_0.5255
I don't need any thanks.
Thank you for your continued support.
everyone!
_0.5258
This is when Mina first regained her memories.
Looks like you can activate the ruins.
_0.5261
As of now, I haven't discovered any other ruins other than that one.
You won't know if you can actually start it until you try it.
_0.5264
Well then everyone, let's do it right away,
Let's go to the ruins to replenish the song energy.
_0.5267
I agree.
I'm sorry, but please lend me your strength, Mylène-san.
_0.5270
If there's something I can do, I'll do my best!
_0.5273
Well, Mylène.
You are with me....
_0.5276
What are you talking about, Leon?
If you lend me the Valkyrie, I can pilot it myself.
_0.5279
Well, I guess so.
He pilots Valkyrie as Sound Force.
_0.5282
That's what I mean.
_0.5285
That's right, we have the perfect aircraft for you.
Your mother, Miria, was on board.
There's a replica of the VF-1J "Valkyrie".
_0.5288
Yeah, it doesn't seem bad.
May I ask you to lend me that?
_0.5291
I think you'll like it.
_0.5294
Mylene's aircraft doesn't seem to have any problems either.
Alto, I'm sorry, but can I have you come too?
With ruins, you never know what you'll find.
_0.5297
Ah, I understand.
_0.5300
I think I know the place, but
I'll set up the navigation just in case.
_0.5303
That's helpful.
Well then, let's go.
_0.5306
I hope we can find a clue that will take us back to our original time...
_0.5309
It depends on Mina's memory and the investigation of the ruins.
Let's get fired up and go!
_0.5312
Although you will lose to my Valkyrie,
It's not a bad aircraft.
_0.5315
As expected from Sound Force.
There doesn't seem to be any problem with steering.
_0.5318
Well, the biggest complaint is,
The control stick is not the base.
_0.5321
The control stick is the base...
_0.5324
What kind of maneuvering method was it?
_0.5327
Hmm, I can't calm down.
_0.5330
We have arrived at our destination ruins.
Don't let your guard down, Mylène, Mina.
_0.5333
Well, leave it to me!
_0.5336
Yes I will try my best!
_0.5339
This is the ruins...
_0.5342
By the way, this is Mylène's first time coming to the ruins.
_0.5345
Yeah. On this planet.
But I've been to Protoculture ruins before.
_0.5348
It seems that traces of protoculture remained on Earth,
The protoculture had spread throughout the galaxy.
_0.5351
Well, anyway, the details about protoculture are
I don't understand.
For now, let's go inside.
_0.5354
Ah, please don't get mad if you get angry.
_0.5357
Gubaba?
_0.5360
Come to think of it, I didn't introduce it.
I've been with you since I was little, and you're like my alter ego.
Hey, Gubaba.
_0.5363
Wow, so cute.
_0.5366
Nice to meet you, Gubaba.
_0.5369
I wanted to ask you,
What kind of man is the legendary rocker Basara Nekki?
_0.5372
Very selfish,
He's a hopelessly selfish guy.
_0.5375
No matter how important the live performance is,
If you decide to let someone else listen to the song,
I'll prioritize that. Whether it's people, mountains, or whales.
_0.5378
Really, you're an idiot.
Anytime, anywhere,
I said, "Listen to my song!"...
_0.5381
And besides...!
_0.5384
Hehe, Mylene-san is talking about Basara-san.
I like it.
_0.5387
What are you talking about, Mina?
Well, that's it...
_0.5390
Hehehe.
_0.5393
By the way, in a gossip magazine,
There were even reports that they were in love.
_0.5396
So, there is nothing called Basara!
That was a fabricated lie...
_0.5399
No, with Basara and Gamlin Captain Kizaki,
It's a passionate relationship that goes beyond friendship...
_0.5402
That's the story! ?
_0.5405
Somehow though,
I think Basara is also coming to Ouroboros.
_0.5408
So Rion. If you find Basara,
It's no good if you don't report it to me properly.
If you take your eyes off me for a moment, I'll go somewhere else.
_0.5411
Ah, I know.
I'll be careful not to let that happen next time.
_0.5414
eh?
What do you mean?
_0.5417
We're almost at the deepest part of this ruins.
Let's hurry.
_0.5420
It looks like we've reached the deepest part.
_0.5423
Should I sing here?
_0.5426
yes.
I will link to the ruins from now on.
Please think of Mylène's loved ones as you sing...
_0.5429
important person?
…I got it. Then I'll go all out!
_0.5432
(My loved ones... Dad, Mom...
in addition………………. )
_0.5435
Mylene's song comes to me...
_0.5438
……………………Ah.
_0.5441
What's wrong, Mina?
Maybe the startup fails...?
_0.5444
No, I was able to activate the ruins without any problems.
I accept Mylène's feelings.
The second ruin is now activated.
_0.5447
Really.
There are a total of six ruins to activate.
That means at least four more divas are coming.
_0.5450
Yeah, I think so.
_0.5453
I wonder who is coming?
Speaking of fun, it's fun.
_0.5456
Haha, that's right.
Well, now that the ruins have finished activating, let's return to the ship.
_0.5459
Phew, I finally made it out of the ruins.
yeah? Aircraft reaction?
_0.5462
From the report that song energy was detected in the ruins
When I came to investigate...you were the cause, Rion.
_0.5465
Is it a rod?
If so, then what!
There's something I want to ask you!
_0.5468
...Hmm, okay.
_0.5471
...What the hell is that guy doing?
_0.5474
The second ruin has now started up.
Going well, going well.
_0.5477
By the way, Mina.
Did you remember anything this time?
_0.5480
...Well, it's just a little bit...
_0.5483
What did you remember?
_0.5486
It's about the era in which I was born.
_0.5493
I was born in the era of protoculture.
Humans flourished on this planet after they disappeared.
Can we call it the ``Ancient Ouroboros Era''?
_0.5496
Humanity flourished after protoculture...
In other words, Mina is not a survivor of protoculture;
I guess he's a human who lived on this planet, Ouroboros.
_0.5499
yes.
But as far as why I ended up sleeping in the ruins...
I couldn't remember....
_0.5502
The activation of the ruins and Mina's memory are progressing smoothly.
I hope things continue to go well for both of us.
I will continue to do my best!
_0.5505
Thank you, Leon.
And Mylène too.
_0.5508
I?
_0.5511
Thanks to Mylene,
I was able to launch the ruins successfully.
_0.5514
I just did what was natural.
Don't worry, Mina.
_0.5517
Now all I have to do is look for Basara...
_0.5520
Come on!
At this rate, let's start up the ruins!
_0.5523
Lion.
I've received a job request from the Hunter Guild.
_0.5526
What kind of request is it?
_0.5529
Apparently it was a request to put down a riot among miners.
Due to the disruption of distribution due to the fold fault,
There seemed to be a problem with the provision of wages and meals.
_0.5532
…As well as money,
People get angry when they run out of food...
_0.5535
I'll be hearing more details at Britai City.
I'm sorry, but Rion, and Alto, could you come too?
_0.5538
Understood.
I can't leave it alone.
_0.5541
Okay, let's go!
_0.5544
The Zentraedi's rampage,
I thought it was getting better...
_0.5547
The ruins haven't finished activating yet.
The fact that it's an unstable situation hasn't changed.
_0.5550
Well, I can't help it if I wake up.
Let's go ask the Hunter Guild for details.
_0.5553
After all, it's nice to be able to fly in the real sky.
_0.5556
Ah, it's different from the artificial sky... This is the sky...
_0.5559
Yes, yes.
I know that we both like the sky,
Please come to the Hunter Guild quickly.
_0.5562
Lion-chan, welcome Desne.
Let's get straight to the point.
_0.5565
The people in the mines wear work battle suits and
Imasu armed with Valkyrie.
_0.5568
Is there even a Valkyrie?
_0.5571
It was used for transporting folded ore,
Dakara is equipped with weapons for use in combat.
_0.5574
That's troublesome.
What about unpaid wages and exploitation?
_0.5577
The authorities have decided to replace them for the time being.
But the blood is rushing to my head and I can't get anyone to listen to me.
_0.5580
So, to some extent,
Does that mean I have to do something rough?
I don't really feel like it...
_0.5583
Kamzin Kravshera, who was in the report,
There is also a story about Alimas collecting Zentraedi.
_0.5586
Understood. I'll deal with it as calmly as possible.
Is that okay?
_0.5589
Of course Deathyo.
Bounty hunters are soldiers and Masendesune.
_0.5592
Well then, let's head to the scene right away.
_0.5595
Vajra is going wild! ?
_0.5598
Damn it!
It's just being controlled by an implant!
Once the implant bullet is destroyed, Vajra should be released!
_0.5601
Understood!
Who the heck would do something like this...?
_0.5604
I received the data, and it's amazing.
_0.5607
This is also a relic of protoculture.
Looks like they used Zentraedi to mine fold ore.
Even just the leftovers are enough for us.
_0.5610
A giant-sized mine shaft?
_0.5613
Well, I hope they'll be quiet and listen to me...
_0.5616
It seems like the Zentraedi are a little deeper inside.
_0.5619
Are those the ones running wild?
_0.5622
Oh, can you hear me?
The issues of food and money have been resolved for the time being.
Will you surrender meekly?
_0.5625
Noisy!
I've been pushed to this point, and I wonder if I'll be able to settle down at that level!
_0.5628
I beg you!
Please respond to the discussion!
_0.5631
If it weren't for you guys,
We can live a better life!
_0.5634
What you're saying is crazy...
Hey, just listen to me!
_0.5637
Can you guys listen to what I have to say?
Shut up you talkative brats!
_0.5640
Don't you listen!
Come on, Leon!
_0.5643
Always pay for the mistakes of the big guys,
We, the settlers, will have to pay!
_0.5646
That's why you resort to violence, don't you?
It doesn't solve anything!
_0.5649
Noisy!
I hope you understand how we feel!
_0.5652
Shit, if this continues, someone will get hurt eventually...!
_0.5655
Please listen to us!
_0.5658
shut up!
What a shame...!
_0.5661
Please stop it already! !
Did you guys want to do something like this?
_0.5664
please remember…….
What you all wanted to protect was your family and lovers, right?
So, don't surrender yourself to the spirit of hatred...!
_0.5667
This song...! ?
_0.5670
It kind of resembles Basara's song...?
_0.5673
Have the riots stopped?
Is it the power of Mina's song?
_0.5676
Deculture....
_0.5679
……Understood.
Let's believe you guys.
_0.5682
Really! ?
_0.5685
ah.
The final deciding factor was that child's song.
Are you a new singer? I'll definitely go listen to it live.
_0.5688
Well, the matter is settled.
I'll leave the rest to the Hunter Guild,
Shall we pull it up?
_0.5691
Leeron, that's what it is.
I just asked for your help.
_0.5694
I understand.
_0.5697
What will happen to those people?
_0.5700
There's so much noise and public opinion is sympathetic to them.
Besides, virtually no one was injured.
I don't think there will be any serious charges.
_0.5703
I see... that's good.
_0.5706
However, if this closed state continues for a long time,
The same thing will happen again.
_0.5709
I'll do my best too!
If my song is useful...!
_0.5712
Yes Yes.
At least it's a feast for my eyes.
_0.5715
Are you recording Mina again with a camera?
I really like you, Aisha.
_0.5718
I have a philosophy of preserving memories.
I told you, right? Zentran has no past.
Well, work, work!
_0.5721
Aiyo.
_0.5724
Let's do our best, everyone!
_0.5727
Lyon, haven't you seen Mylene?
_0.5730
No, I haven't seen it yet today.
What's wrong?
_0.5733
I have something to do, but you can't find me anywhere.
_0.5736
Well then, I guess I'll try looking for it too.
_0.5739
I'll ask you.
_0.5742
roger that.
Maybe I'll go to the hanger first.
_0.5745
Mina, haven't you seen Mylene?
_0.5748
Mylène-san just said,
I said, "I'm going to look for Basara."
I took off in VF-1.
_0.5751
Because he was dignified,
I thought I had Aisha's permission, but...
Isn't that so?
_0.5754
Tsk, this is why I grew up as a young lady...
I can't just leave it like this,
I'll look for it in a bit.
_0.5757
I guess I should go with you.
Let's go out when we're ready.
_0.5760
Too bad Alto.
_0.5763
Aisha, can't you connect to Mylène?
_0.5766
That VF-1's long-range communication device is quite shaky.
Due to the interference of Ouroboros Aurora,
The IFF signal doesn't hit either...
_0.5769
I guess I just have to search steadily...
It can't be helped, so I'll try going to the nearest town for now.
_0.5772
I have no choice but to ask if you have seen Mylène...
_0.5775
Sorry, but
Don't you know the girl in this photo?
_0.5778
Oh, that's Mylène Genus when she debuted!
_0.5781
Otakus also have great hobbies!
Her parents are legendary ace pilots, and her partner is that hot-tempered bastard!
_0.5784
The terrifying legacy of the Protoculture era, which plunged the galaxy into crisis.
A rocker girl who fought against “Proto Devil” with the power of song!
Hmm, that's good, it's numbing.
_0.5787
Then, when I said Mylène-chan...
_0.5790
...I'm sorry for speaking so passionately, but...
I'll get you another one.
_0.5793
Apparently it doesn't seem like it's going to be in this town.
_0.5796
I also tried to ask, but
There was no information about anyone seeing Mylène.
_0.5799
As expected, searching blindly would be too reckless.
If there is no information...
_0.5802
That's right...
For now, let's go to a different city.
_0.5805
That's it.
If it's the Hunter's Guild, it looks like you'll get a lot of information.
Should I ask Leeron if he has any information?
_0.5808
Hi, this is Leeron, Masdeath.
_0.5811
I'm looking for someone,
Could you please check to see if the guild has received any information?
_0.5814
What kind of person are you looking for, Desca?
_0.5817
It would be faster to see it than to tell you.
I'll send you the data so you can check it out.
_0.5820
I understand.
I think it will take some time,
I'll contact you if I find out anything.
_0.5823
I'm sorry, please help me.
_0.5826
I hope I have some information...
_0.5829
There's no point in just waiting like this,
Should I try going to the next city?
_0.5832
Not that there's any hope, but
It can't be helped, I'd like to ask you some questions.
_0.5835
Hmm, I don't know any information like this.
_0.5838
Leeron might be contacting you.
Let's go back to Valkyrie for a moment.
_0.5841
I guess I have no choice but to take a chance on that.
_0.5844
Leon, the information is terrible.
_0.5847
Really?
_0.5850
I saw Mylène in Leopold City.
Well, apparently there was some information.
_0.5853
Please tell me the location of that city.
_0.5856
I understand.
I sent the data, so please confirm.
_0.5859
That's helpful, Leeron.
_0.5862
Do you have any more detailed information?
I'm still going to look into this as well.
_0.5865
According to the information from Leeron,
Apparently there was a Mylene in this town...
_0.5868
Sorry, did you see the girl in this photo?
_0.5871
Ah, that kid is going to a nearby floating island.
I was just flying away in Valkyrie.
_0.5874
I'm sure Basara would go somewhere like that.
You said that, but what do you mean?
_0.5877
bingo! Thank you!
_0.5880
As expected, the information came from Leeron.
_0.5883
Let's head to the information location.
_0.5886
That's helpful, Leeron.
Thanks to that, I think I'll be able to find Mylène.
_0.5889
That's good, Des.
And apparently Mylène Nandesu...
Desune seems to have asked the guild for information in order to find Basara.
_0.5892
I was asked if I knew anything about anything.
A strange tourist traveling with an acoustic guitar,
There is a story about being in Leopold City.
_0.5895
I see, so it jumped out on its own.
So he went looking for Basara.
_0.5898
Death like that.
_0.5901
Thank you.
All that's left to do is bring the runaway girl home.
_0.5906
Lion!
Mylene's guy is surrounded by bandits!
_0.5909
It seems like he's running into trouble.
Hurry up, Alto!
_0.5912
What the hell is going on with you guys!
You've been following me around for a while now!
_0.5915
Would you please come with us?
Mylène Genus.
_0.5918
Well, that's something I can't discuss.
_0.5921
Lion!
Sorry, give me a hand! Somehow these people
He suddenly tried to grab me...!
_0.5924
I don't feel like they're going to let me go home like this.
_0.5927
Do it!
_0.5930
Tsk, I don't know who it is, but...
That's the one that got my hands on it first.
Don't complain if you get rejected!
_0.5933
Are these guys really bandits?
However, there is unity in movement...
_0.5936
T-strong...! ?
Is this the hunter mentioned in the report?
_0.5939
what up?
Even if you can chase girls around,
Can't you fight against hunters?
_0.5942
We have no choice but to retreat!
_0.5945
Mylene, are you okay?
_0.5948
thanks. I showed you something embarrassing.
Even an old-fashioned Valkyrie is fine for me!
That's what I thought, but I let my guard down a bit.
_0.5951
I think it's cramped, but
Please give me a shout when you go alone.
_0.5954
Sorry for acting like Basara.
I will reflect!
_0.5957
I'll help you find Basara,
Let's go back to the ship.
_0.5960
Yeah!
_0.5963
To the guys who were trying to kidnap you,
Do you have any idea?
_0.5966
It can't be!
They just threatened to have me come along suddenly.
_0.5969
For a gathering of bandits, their movements were well-organized,
Maybe they're military?
_0.5972
So, we apologize for the inconvenience!
Sorry for acting selfishly!
_0.5975
Thanks to Leon, nothing happened,
I almost got kidnapped.
_0.5978
Yes, I am seriously reflecting on this...
_0.5981
Aisha and Mylène are also reflecting on this...
_0.5984
I understand.
From now on, if you give me a call, I have no intention of tying you down.
Please be sure to take care of that.
_0.5987
Yeah, I understand.
_0.5990
Mylène-san, let's look for Basara-san together.
I also want to listen to Basara-san's songs properly.
_0.5993
I'll help you too. I don't know him directly, but
Is there any artist who hasn't been influenced by Basara?
Something that can't be found anywhere else in the galaxy. Including me.
_0.5996
Yes, thank you!
Okay, wait for me, Basara!
I'll definitely find it! !
_0.5999
That's it, Rion.
I'm going out for a while.
_0.6002
yeah?
Oh, be careful when you go.
_0.6005
Hey Mina, where did Aisha go?
_0.6008
Apparently he's going to see Commander Todo.
_0.6011
Is Todo the Todo of Havamar? ?
_0.6014
yes.
He said he was going to ask for information about the ruins.
_0.6017
If so, take me too!
There was something I wanted to ask Rod!
_0.6020
I think you would say...
You also said that you would go without telling Leon?
_0.6023
Damn... that Aisha guy.
_0.6026
In any case, it was an errand that couldn't be completed by communication, right?
I was starting to get a little worried about whether Aisha would be okay alone.
_0.6029
Well, if it's Aisha, she'll be fine without an escort.
Well then, I'll go out for a bit too.
_0.6032
Is Leon also going out?
Oh, maybe you're going after Aisha?
_0.6035
Don't do that.
It just flies out a little bit.
_0.6038
got it.
Welcome, Leon.
_0.6041
It's Aisha's guy.
There's no need to keep it a secret from me...
_0.6044
It seems that Todo has been researching the ruins for some time now.
What purpose does it serve?
I don't think it's for academic purposes like Aisha's.
_0.6047
It's worth investigating for someone so powerful.
There's power in those ruins...?
_0.6050
Come to think of it, Leeron knew Todo...
Shall we go to Buritai City?
_0.6053
Is Aisha back?
_0.6056
No, he hasn't come back yet.
_0.6059
Really…. Then I'll come out a little more.
Let's go, Mina.
_0.6062
Hey, Leon. What's wrong Desune?
Desca want some information?
_0.6065
Just a little.
I've heard about the special forces of the New Joint Forces,
How big is Havamar?
_0.6068
Todo was also kind of incomprehensible,
Above all, why is the rod guy...?
_0.6071
Anyway, it's a big unit Desne.
In order to resolve conflicts between the convoy and the military during immigration,
There are rumors that it was Havamar who was behind the scenes.
_0.6074
Desuga, which even we didn't know about at the time.
After their existence became clear, their authority increased.
Both the budget and personnel are at an all-time high.
_0.6077
I know of special forces, or an organization like the intelligence department.
As soon as he found out, he changed his name and disappeared.
_0.6080
Unfortunately, that's the only amount of information I can get.
I can't find any information about Havamar.
_0.6083
Thank you.
If you have any information about that, please let me know.
_0.6086
I understand that Todo recognizes Aisha's abilities,
For exchanging information about ruins,
S. M. Is it easy to interact with S?
_0.6089
I guess it's only possible because they're both top leaders...
_0.6092
It can't be helped.
Shall I also investigate the ruins?
_0.6095
When it comes to ruins, Aisha is indiscriminate.
I'm worried that Todo isn't treating me well...
_0.6098
The organization from the intelligence department,
I can't imagine that we came into contact by chance...
No...I guess that's just too much of a concern.
_0.6101
Lion!
Please come back to Gefion right now!
_0.6104
Oh! Aisha, are you back?
If you're going to see Todo,
It would have been better if you had just called out to me.
_0.6107
Don't be rude.
People who are likely to become a source of trouble,
There's no way I can take her with me.
_0.6110
Leaving that aside,
I received information about the ruins from Havamar.
_0.6113
...Don't you trust me too much?
_0.6116
Not really.
No matter how you look at it, their research is more widespread.
_0.6119
I just want to know the location of the ruins, so it's actually convenient.
_0.6122
I see, so now we're going to investigate the ruins.
I'll be back soon.
_0.6125
Please, thanks.
_0.6128
Looks like Aisha has returned safely.
I'm glad it turned out to be a pointless worry...
_0.6131
Welcome back, Leon.
I met with the Havamar ruins investigation team.
_0.6134
Isn't it with Todo?
_0.6137
Commander Todo also serves as the head of that group.
_0.6140
Today there are some ruins and
I learned about some interesting ruins.
_0.6143
Havamar spent years investigating the gap in the fold fault.
It seems like they are searching and moving between areas,
Of course, they couldn't tell me about that route because it was confidential.
_0.6146
However, at the same time as the ouroboros aurora
There are ruins where spatial fluctuation values have been detected as abnormal.
I think the ruins are a fold fault control device...
_0.6149
In other words, I think it's a ruin that controls the Ouroboros Aurora.
_0.6152
Control of Ouroboros Aurora?
There is a device that artificially prevents people from leaving areas or planets.
Does that mean?
_0.6155
Is it for some kind of experiment or something related to Mina?
I need to investigate that as well.
There's a possibility that it's just what Todo had in mind...
_0.6158
If that ruin is ouroboros aurora control device,
If you can use it,
It means you'll be able to leave the planet.
_0.6161
I hope so.
_0.6164
Okay, then let's go right away.
_0.6167
I'm going too.
I think I can help too.
_0.6170
Nice to meet you. Mina.
There's a good chance I'll rely on Mina's memory and strength.
I did a little research and found out that manipulating the ruins is too dangerous.
_0.6173
Alright!
Let's leave as soon as we finish checking the equipment.
_0.6176
If we can control ouroboros aurora,
That means we've solved one problem on this planet.
_0.6179
Yes, let's do our best to make that happen!
_0.6182
This is the ruins of the problem.
_0.6185
Now, what will come out...
_0.6188
amazing!
The entire ruins are overflowing with fold energy!
The fluctuating numbers are more than I expected, so this is bingo!
_0.6191
Aisha, it's good to get excited, but
Please be aware of your surroundings.
_0.6194
I-I know...
This is information from Havamar, but all over Ouroboros.
I'm told that the movement of the guardian weapons is becoming more active.
_0.6197
The activation of the ruins should be progressing, but what on earth is going on...?
_0.6200
The purpose of this article is to investigate that.
_0.6203
Understood.
Don't leave me, both of you.
_0.6206
You came out right away!
Sorry, but I'll let you down.
_0.6209
These guys are getting tougher! ?
_0.6212
It looks like the specs of the guardian weapons have also improved.
Don't let your guard down!
_0.6215
By replenishing singing energy,
It looks like the related ruins and guardian weapons are being activated together.
_0.6218
Mylene replenished her song energy in the previous ruins,
There is also a fold wave from this ruins.
There's also the fact that it's now released.
_0.6221
So what we've done is
So it wasn't a mistake.
We have to work hard to activate the remaining ruins, Mina.
_0.6224
Yes! !
_0.6227
Hey, there's a big protective weapon! !
_0.6230
That's not the guy who fought in the ruins where Mina was! ?
Last time, I couldn't investigate because it self-destructed.
this time……!
_0.6233
hey hey….
Like before, ``It's precious, so don't destroy it!'' ”
That's not true, right?
_0.6236
Ugh! I want to say that, I want to say that, but...
I can't even say that!
Defeat it without destroying it as much as possible!
_0.6239
Generally understood!
Don't hold a grudge if things don't go well!
_0.6242
Damn it!
As expected, the performance is different from the smaller one!
_0.6245
Lion can do it!
I wish you the best!
_0.6248
The fold material inside has become inactive.
It looks like the reactor is down as well, so I don't think it will need to be restarted.
_0.6251
It doesn't seem like he'll self-destruct this time.
_0.6254
Now you can investigate this guy as much as you like!
_0.6257
Aisha.
It looks like there's a control device in the back,
Let's move on quickly.
_0.6260
And of course it's not. Mina.
Just kidding, kidding.
Now, let's head to the control room quickly!
_0.6263
This looks like the Ouroboros Aurora's control room.
Just like the ruins that replenish song energy,
Should I try to control it?
_0.6266
I think there's no problem with that.
_0.6269
I asked for it, Mina.
_0.6272
Yes, let's try it.
_0.6275
Kya! !
_0.6278
what! ?
_0.6281
what?
It shook a lot.
Mina. Does this mean that the ruins were activated with the current operation?
_0.6284
yes.
Safely reach the Ouroboros Aurora control ruins.
I was able to start it.
_0.6287
You did it, Mina!
_0.6290
But...the ouroboros aurora of the entire planet
It's like I couldn't control it...
_0.6293
eh!
What do you mean, Mina?
_0.6296
What you can control with this ruin is:
Cutting off the Uriah Archipelago and the Sierra Desert
Looks like it was just Ouroboros Aurora...
_0.6299
Although it is now possible to go to the Sierra Desert,
So we can't leave this planet yet?
_0.6302
Sorry, it seems like that...
_0.6305
There's no need for Mina to apologize.
In any case, the Ouroboros incident has not subsided yet.
_0.6308
The more I just gave up here and went back to Sephira,
I'm not heartless either.
_0.6311
Yes, Mina.
It turns out that we can control the Ouroboros Aurora.
It's not a very big step.
_0.6314
That's right….
Yes!
Let's keep doing our best!
_0.6317
Well, it looks like there's nothing left to do in this ruins.
Shall we go home then?
_0.6320
fault?
Is this something?
_0.6323
What's wrong?
_0.6326
A message is being displayed.
I'll try to decipher it, but it might take some time.
Well, I can go home while analyzing it, so let's go.
_0.6329
That's right, then let's get out of the ruins.
_0.6332
I was able to get out of the ruins safely.
All that's left is to return to the ship...
_0.6335
Ah!
_0.6338
What's wrong, Aisha?
I was suddenly surprised...
_0.6341
I have finished analyzing the message from earlier...
_0.6344
Isn't it amazing? What did you mean?
_0.6347
Looks like it was a security warning...
_0.6350
In other words?
_0.6353
That doesn't mean we're safe yet...
_0.6356
teeth?
_0.6359
Oaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ! ! !
What is this big guy? ?
_0.6362
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ! !
_0.6365
Are you okay, Mina?
Damn it! Don't get carried away! !
_0.6368
Damn it!
How hard is this guy...!
If this continues like this, it's going to get really bad...
_0.6371
...Hmm, I guess this is the limit of your arm.
_0.6374
yeah! ?
_0.6377
From now on, it will be in attack mode.
Each aircraft formation α!
_0.6380
rod! ?
_0.6383
I'm not here to help.
He was just following Commander Todo's orders.
_0.6386
Hey, don't ask me that!
_0.6389
...Start the attack.
_0.6392
I never thought I would be flying with you again!
_0.6395
Shut up and fight...
_0.6398
Hey, since when did you join Havamar...?
_0.6401
Just shut up and fight!
_0.6404
...It's still the same as before,
It's just a rough maneuver.
_0.6407
Ah?
Did you say something?
_0.6410
...Confirm the formation of each aircraft.
...I'll finish you off!
_0.6413
Okay! ! It's our victory!
_0.6416
Mission accomplished, all aircraft return home.
_0.6419
Rod, wait a minute!
Listen to me for a little while!
_0.6422
Mission accomplished.
Besides, I have nothing to talk about with you...
_0.6425
rod! !
Hey, what happened to you?
What have you become since Mia died...!
_0.6428
what? What's wrong with me?
Don't say I've gone crazy,
Lion?
_0.6433
On the contrary, I would like to ask you a question.
How can you live peacefully in a world without Mia?
Was that the extent of Mia's existence for you?
_0.6436
I'm different!
I will take care of Mia...!
_0.6439
rod! ?
What are you doing...
_0.6442
...Odin 1 returns to the ship.
_0.6445
Leon, let's get back to the ship.
_0.6448
Ah, I understand...
_0.6451
The Ouroboros Aurora in the Yuria Archipelago has now been unlocked.
I'm heading to the Sierra Desert right away.
_0.6454
Course setting completed!
_0.6457
Everything is stable, including each numerical value and dimensional boundary line!
_0.6460
OK, let's go!
_0.6463
rod…….
You... no, you're still thinking about Mia...
_0.6466
Ah, you woke up. Lion.
_0.6469
...Mina was singing?
_0.6472
sorry. He seemed annoyed, so
I thought it would be a good substitute for a lullaby...
In the end, I woke you up...
_0.6475
No, it's okay.
I was able to wake up to Mina's song,
I feel somewhat good.
_0.6478
But, uh... are you sure it's okay?
I've been calling someone Mia by name for a long time...?
_0.6481
...She's my sister. He was a pilot.
_0.6484
…was?
_0.6487
Two years ago, in Sephira where we live,
A fleet of rogue Zentraedi appears.
_0.6490
Minmei attacks and negotiations had no effect,
The war turned into a quagmire before reinforcements arrived from home.
_0.6493
Did you participate in the war?
_0.6496
Of course, me and my friend Rod, who were still new recruits,
Even his younger sister Mia was drawn to the front lines.
_0.6499
Mia and Rod have been lovers since they were kids.
It was so hot that I couldn't stand it...
_0.6502
...So, what happened to the war?
_0.6505
Somehow Sephira was saved and the war was over.
But Mia...
_0.6508
After that, I quit the military and S. M. I joined S.
He quit the military because it was painful to remember Mia, but
I couldn't give up flying...
_0.6511
No, for me at that time,
I guess that was the only option...
_0.6514
Lion...
_0.6517
I'm sorry, Mina.
Thank you for listening to this story.
You're the first person I've told anyone about this.
_0.6520
Don't worry about that.
If Leon feels even a little better,
I'm very happy.
_0.6523
Not only that.
Mina's song made me feel lighter.
Your song is a song that can save people.
_0.6526
The person who was always next to me is gone...
I can't accept it so easily...
_0.6529
Really….
Mina is no longer with her family and friends...
_0.6532
There are a lot of people's positions and circumstances.
_0.6535
Everyone has their own life that is the most difficult.
There's no point in comparing yourself to anyone else.
_0.6538
Also, I was able to meet Rion and Aisha.
I'm so happy now!
_0.6543
Ah!
It looks like I was able to safely fold into the Sierra Desert.
I'll make dinner!
_0.6546
Ah, I'll order something special.
_0.6549
That's right...
_0.6552
Ever since then, I've been running away from flying alone...
But that's not the case with me right now...
_0.6555
Hey... Mia...?
_0.6558
Leon, are you okay?
Mina was worried though.
_0.6561
Ah, it's okay now.
_0.6564
Yes...if you have any questions, please talk to me.
_0.6567
I'm sorry for worrying you.
When that happens, I'll ask for your help.
_0.6570
Hehe, don't worry about it.
_0.6573
Well, we finally arrived at the Sierra Desert,
I have to decide what I'm going to do from now on.
_0.6576
In this desert hunter guild,
Isn't it okay to gather information in a flow?
_0.6579
That's what I was thinking too,
Actually, I can't contact the Hunter Guild.
_0.6582
In that case, I have no choice but to go directly to the city.
_0.6585
It seems so.
Well, there's a hunter guild in a town called Creef Town,
Please go.
_0.6588
Understood.
Well, I guess I'll invite Alto too and go on a scenic flight in the desert.
_0.6591
Is this the desert?
It was my first time seeing it, but it was pretty amazing.
I'm getting thirsty just looking at it.
_0.6594
I think you already know, but
This desert area is called the ``Sierra Desert''.
_0.6597
This area is really nothing but desert,
Please take good care of yourself so you don't get overwhelmed by the heat.
_0.6600
Understood.
Be careful flying around there.
_0.6603
It's really full of sand no matter where you go.
_0.6606
When you see this scenery from the Yulia Archipelago,
As expected, it doesn't feel odd at all.
_0.6609
Then, let's enjoy the desert and head to the city.
_0.6612
Ah, if you say so!
Don't go near Havermar Base, which is surrounded by rocky mountains.
It seems to be an important base, so it will be attacked without warning.
_0.6615
It's an important base in Havamar...
understood.
_0.6618
I feel kind of lonely...
_0.6621
It's a desert, isn't it like this?
_0.6624
According to Aisha, the Sierra Desert is the most popular ouroboros.
Vanquish lace is the most popular,
The town seems to be quite lively as well.
_0.6627
Vanquish?
It's a race that uses Valkyries.
However, the atmosphere is not very lively.
_0.6630
That's right.
Let's go to the Hunter's Guild and collect some information.
_0.6633
Hey, what the hell is going on?
The Hunter Guild isn't doing it.
_0.6636
This is the Sierra Desert,
There seems to be no doubt that there is a problem.
_0.6639
Is there nothing I can do if I stay here?
Let's contact Aisha.
_0.6642
Aisha, I went to the Hunter Guild...
_0.6645
Ah, just in the right place!
I ended the investigation for now and returned to the ship.
The location of a new ruin has been identified.
_0.6648
Ruins?
Okay, I'll be right back.
_0.6651
I'm concerned that the Hunter Guild wasn't functioning,
I'll ask Leeron about that.
_0.6654
It seems better to have them do that.
So they say they discovered new ruins.
It was pretty easy to find.
_0.6657
The ruins where Mina was sleeping,
There are ruins emitting fold waves with the same pattern.
It was detected.
_0.6662
Hey, I think it's a good thing that we were able to discover the ruins.
Me and Sheryl are already singing,
You can't activate the ruins even if you go, right?
_0.6665
That's right though.
There may be new discoveries,
I want to investigate.
_0.6668
In a situation like this, it wouldn't be a bad idea to investigate the ruins.
_0.6671
Well then, Alto, Mina.
Let's leave when we're ready.
_0.6674
Is this the first ruin in this desert?
_0.6677
Structurally, I think it's no different from the one in the Yulia Archipelago.
Please don't worry about that.
_0.6680
I have to do my best to find information about the ruins...!
_0.6683
Don't worry about that, Mina.
Let's take it easy.
_0.6686
This is the ruins we're after.
_0.6689
Three stone pillars....
this is……?
_0.6692
There's no point in standing here.
Let's go inside.
_0.6695
It really does look like sand.
Even though Valkyrie has undergone dustproof treatment,
I can't seem to calm down.
_0.6698
Believe in my maintenance.
Now, please investigate thoroughly.
_0.6701
Hmm.
_0.6704
What happened?
_0.6707
Although it was difficult to distinguish, countless footprints were detected by the sensor.
It looks like there was a previous visitor to this ruins.
That's also relatively recent.
_0.6710
Todo and others...
Hadn't Havamar investigated first?
_0.6713
The footprints belong to Valkyrie, so it's possible.
Let's find out a little more.
_0.6716
It's out!
_0.6719
After all, individuals from the Sierra Desert,
It seems to be technologically the same as the one in the Yuria Archipelago.
_0.6722
Relationship with protoculture...
What if it's something that imitates Vajra...?
_0.6725
Leave your academic interests for later!
It's coming!
_0.6728
I managed to get it fixed.
_0.6731
thank you for your hard work.
Looks like we can move forward with this.
_0.6734
That's right.
Then let's go inside.
_0.6737
Are you serious! ?
_0.6740
What are these guys?
That guy from earlier is so annoying!
_0.6743
We have no choice but to fight back!
I'll intercept you!
_0.6746
Is this all?
_0.6749
Honestly, without this, the investigation would go much easier.
_0.6752
That was cool, Leon!
_0.6755
Thank you for your compliment.
We're almost at the bottom now.
_0.6758
It seems like I've reached the deepest part...
This place seems to be different from the ruins used to replenish song energy.
_0.6761
It seems so.
copper? Mina, do you know something?
_0.6764
Yes, I'll look into it.
_0.6767
this is…….
_0.6770
Yay! No! !
_0.6773
Mina! !
_0.6776
No, it's okay.
I was just a little surprised...
_0.6779
Is it really okay?
It didn't really look like that, but...
_0.6782
Well...if you touch this ruin...
Many memories flooded into my head...
_0.6785
record? Isn't it a memory?
_0.6788
…Maybe this ruins,
Maybe it's a database from the ancient Ouroboros era.
_0.6791
That huge amount of data began to flow into Mina,
Mina must have been pissed.
_0.6794
Yes, yes.
I think so.
I'm kind of scared...
_0.6797
I'm glad you didn't mess around.
If you try to forcefully memorize the data here,
It puts an incredible load on your brain.
_0.6800
However, if we can collect data here,
Does that mean you can find out more detailed information about the ruins?
_0.6803
That may be true, but
I have no intention of making Mina do anything more than this.
Is there something we can do, Aisha?
_0.6806
It may take some time, but
I'll try to analyze it here, so it's okay.
_0.6809
But...!
I feel like I've always been spoiled by your kindness...
_0.6812
Your song helped me too.
It's natural for me to help Mina.
_0.6815
She's our precious daughter.
_0.6818
It's been a long time since I last talked about this topic.
Yes, it is true that it is important.
_0.6821
Me too...Rion and Aisha are an important family.
_0.6824
I would be happy if you could say that.
Now, the preparation for analysis is complete.
Shall we go home?
_0.6829
Phew.
You're finally back outside.
_0.6832
I'm glad you're safe, Aisha! !
_0.6835
Gunness! ?
What the hell are you in a place like this?
_0.6838
I have something for you guys!
Aisha! Come to me quietly! !
What?
_0.6841
What are you saying all of a sudden?
Still stupid!
_0.6844
Heh!
You won't regret it, Aisha!
I am the man who will rule all bandits and become the king!
_0.6847
King?
What are you talking about in your sleep?
How many bandits of Ouroboros do you think there are?
_0.6850
Ah, I understand very well.
_0.6853
With my current strength,
You can unite the bandits! !
_0.6856
Gunness bastard, if you're going to do it, I won't hold back!
_0.6859
Bandit King!
_0.6862
...What a mesmerizing sound.
Gunness will do his best, brother!
_0.6865
Big brother? Who the hell are you talking about?
_0.6868
Well, if it happens here, there's no point!
We'll leave with this.
Goodbye, Aisha! I love you! !
_0.6871
I love you!
...What a bold person.
_0.6874
Mina, don't worry about that.
_0.6877
What's that anyway?
What was it for?
Even though you're Ganesu, I'm annoyed that you're bothering me...!
_0.6880
I'm also curious about the big brother he was talking about.
I understand that you aren't thinking things through, but...
_0.6883
Okay, okay.
Let's get back to the ship!
_0.6886
Analysis of the database found in the ruins
I hope things go smoothly.
_0.6889
sorry….
If only I could memorize data properly...
_0.6892
No one is blaming Mina.
_0.6895
Yes, Mina.
No matter how much I love ruins,
Mina is definitely more important.
_0.6898
Aisha....
_0.6901
Come on, don't cry.
This kid is really cute.
_0.6904
Looking at it this way, it doesn't look like they are close sisters.
_0.6907
What are you talking about, Leon?
Mina is my precious daughter!
_0.6912
Hehe, thank you for your continued support.
Aisha mama! Rion Papa!
_0.6917
Huh?
_0.6920
Hehehehehe.
_0.6923
By the way, about the Hunter Guild...
Did you get confirmation from Leeron?
_0.6926
It's like jamming is happening all over the Sierra Desert.
I can't communicate with the Yuria Archipelago.
_0.6929
jamming?
_0.6932
Unfortunately, I don't know the cause.
_0.6935
Ha, ha, ha….
_0.6938
yeah?
Hey Sheryl, don't you have a fever?
_0.6941
I just worked a little too hard on my singing lessons.
Please don't worry so much.
_0.6944
Don't force yourself.
Hey, you should lie down.
_0.6947
...If Mylène tells me, I have no choice but to obey.
I'm sorry, but I'll let you rest for a while.
_0.6950
Cheryl, are you okay?
_0.6953
I know you're worried, but
Let me get back to the topic.
_0.6956
It seems to be related to jamming,
Apparently Bandit has been to the Sierra Desert recently.
It looks like they're gathering.
_0.6959
In that case, if you come into contact with the bandit,
Maybe we can find out the cause of the jamming.
_0.6962
Looks like Gunness was planning something too.
I hope I can figure out what they're up to...
The priority now is to identify the cause of the jamming.
_0.6965
As a result, it looks like we'll be able to exterminate the bandits.
It would be easy if there was a jamming device nearby...
_0.6968
alto,
I'm sure you're interested in Sheryl, but would you like to go out with me?
_0.6971
Ah, ah, I understand. Let's leave.
_0.6974
I would like to be on Cheryl's side, but
Please concentrate on exterminating the bandits.
_0.6977
Ah, I know.
_0.6980
Wait, what is the purpose of these guys?
_0.6983
There is also no jamming device in sight.
Aren't these guys on the bottom?
_0.6986
Siegfried 1, can you hear me?
_0.6989
I can hear it somehow, but it has a strong influence of jamming.
_0.6992
I have to do something soon...
_0.6995
Phew, you shot down quite a few.
_0.6998
In the end, there was no information that could be a clue.
_0.7001
yeah?
Is it a message from the ship?
_0.7004
Mr. Alto! Cheryl's fever is getting high!
Um, uh, what should I do...!
_0.7007
Cheryl! ? Will be back soon!
_0.7010
Leon, please come back soon!
_0.7015
Ah!
I am back!
_0.7018
Mina! Cheryl! ?
_0.7021
I'm calm now.
It seems like your fever was temporarily high just now.
_0.7024
Really…. good.
_0.7027
Mina was amazing.
When I touched Cheryl's forehead, she burst into tears.
_0.7030
Because it was really hot!
_0.7033
Even so, I was in trouble.
Cheryl isn't feeling well, and the communication status is terrible...
_0.7036
Ah, there's a message!
_0.7039
Desune finally connected.
_0.7042
Isn't it Leeron?
How are you communicating from the Yuria Archipelago? ?
_0.7045
Descara, unable to give up, has come to the Sierra Desert.
With the efforts of Lion-chan and others,
Travel between the archipelago and the desert is now possible.
_0.7048
Even so, it seems like this guild is still capable of work.
Desne not in condition.
_0.7051
Leeron.
Do you know what's going on here in the Sierra Desert?
_0.7054
A group of bandits called "Strange Bear"
Desuyo seems to have acquired the New Joint Force's wide-area jamming device.
_0.7057
Because of that, I can't get in touch with Desdakara properly.
The desert hunter guild function has stopped.
_0.7060
I guess it was interference after all.
But why is a wide area jamming device a bandit?
_0.7063
Someone within the New Joint Forces is stealing it.
There is information that.
_0.7066
Lion-chan, in order to resolve this commotion,
Eliminate “Strange Bear” from the Hunter Guild
Desyo makes a formal request.
_0.7069
Got it, Leeron!
Leave it to me!
_0.7072
I don't want communication to end here.
I'll send you the location too, Dakara, please do your best!
_0.7075
Someone...
Well, I know the place.
Let's destroy the jamming device.
_0.7078
Ah, Cheryl isn't in her best condition yet either.
I'll finish it quickly.
_0.7081
I sent you the location of the jamming device.
It seems like the people living in the Sierra Desert are also in trouble.
We need to destroy the jamming device.
_0.7084
Understood.
Also, I'm sorry, but could someone please watch over Cheryl?
_0.7087
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you in the infirmary.
_0.7090
Was he hiding a jamming device in a cave?
They're not all lowly like the guys before me.
Don't let your guard down!
_0.7093
I know.
_0.7096
It looks like we're here to welcome you.
_0.7099
Welcome?
Will you be welcomed?
_0.7102
Ahh.
It looks like they'll welcome you with a bang, with bullets and missiles!
_0.7105
It's more chewy than I expected.
_0.7108
Device defense force? That's troublesome.
_0.7111
I'm sure it's troublesome, but that's about it! !
_0.7114
They really use the cave as their hideout.
_0.7117
According to Hunter Guild data,
Extorting tolls from people passing through these areas,
He seems to be doing whatever he wants, including extortion, theft, and robbery.
_0.7120
Are those guys using jamming devices?
Villains don't change no matter where they go.
_0.7123
Siegfried 1 infiltrates the enemy's hideout.
_0.7126
The search for a wide-area jamming device will now begin.
_0.7129
What, temera! ?
For what purpose...!
_0.7132
If a hunter breaks into the bandit's hideout,
You've already decided what you're going to do!
I'll get you prepared!
_0.7135
T-strong...!
_0.7138
Temera is too weak!
_0.7141
The jamming device seems to be deeper inside...
_0.7144
Are you the ones who hurt my children?
_0.7147
I'll clean it up for you too, so get ready!
_0.7150
Let's talk!
I'll sink you into the desert sea!
_0.7153
Argh!
It's supposed to be like this...
_0.7156
Hey cola!
What are you doing there? ?
_0.7159
Hey there, Gunness.
You'll understand when you see it. You're destroying the jamming device!
_0.7162
Stop it!
_0.7165
Chikishooo!
Remember it!
_0.7168
That's a pretty lame throwaway line.
_0.7171
This is Siegfried 1.
Successfully subdued "Strange Bear".
I don't know why, but Gunness was there too.
_0.7174
I also destroyed the jamming device.
It can't be any worse now.
_0.7177
Thank you, Leon-chan.
Please come to Creef Town once.
_0.7180
Huh. I feel calm when I go outside.
_0.7185
Big brother! Suiyasen!
I was careless and almost destroyed it...
_0.7188
Tsk!
It's going to be difficult! !
_0.7191
...Those two. What are you planning?
_0.7194
I think I was heading to Creef Town.
I hope this will restore the functionality of the Hunter Guild.
_0.7197
Lion-chan! Hey Death!
Thanks to that, Deathyo has started to make contact with the desert hunters!
It really helped me!
_0.7200
I was in trouble too.
While exterminating the bandits, a Gunness bastard even came out.
It was a little tricky though.
_0.7203
However, I'm glad that the communication situation seems to have been fixed.
_0.7206
From now on, the Yulia Archipelago and the Sierra Desert,
Death that covers both!
_0.7209
And if there are other cities that have fallen into bandit hands,
I ask for your release as well, Desyo!
_0.7212
Understood.
I'll keep asking for you, Leeron.
_0.7215
It looks like the Sierra Desert will be a little more peaceful now.
_0.7218
Ahh.
However, Ganeth and Kamjin joined forces,
You must have been up to some trickery.
_0.7221
If you still do bad things,
I don't think it's decided yet?
_0.7224
No, I'm sure you'll do something bad.
After all, it's Kamjin.
_0.7227
The guy from Gunness,
“Let’s do our best for the world together! ”
I can't imagine thinking that.
_0.7230
I don't know what you're planning, but
Looks like we'll be seeing each other again in the future.
_0.7233
The Hunter Guild is now functioning properly,
Now, if Cheryl's health gets better...
_0.7236
Lion!
Cheryl has a fever again...!
_0.7239
Damn, it's not that convenient.
_0.7242
Aisha and Mina are accompanying me now,
We don't really know what causes high fever...
_0.7245
S. M. There is no information in S's database either.
If there is any clue...!
_0.7248
Standing here won't solve anything.
Let's go around the surrounding towns and find out about endemic diseases!
_0.7251
Ah, uh...
_0.7254
Cheryl is
A long time ago, when I was born, there was a fever that was prevalent.
Maybe it got infected.
_0.7257
Ancient Ouroboros fever...? !
_0.7260
I don't even remember the treatment, but
In the database of those ruins
I'm sure there is a cure for that!
_0.7263
Those ruins?
Are you talking about the three pillar database ruins?
_0.7266
yes.
In those ruins there are ancient Ouroboros era
The data should have been recorded.
_0.7269
Aisha, you're analyzing the database ruins, right?
Is there any information about Cheryl's illness?
_0.7272
That database has too much information,
I haven't been able to fully analyze it yet.
_0.7275
I think I'll be the quickest to link.
_0.7278
But that's...
It's going to be a huge burden on Mina, right?
_0.7281
Cheryl is suffering!
If it's in my power to help, I have to do what I can!
_0.7284
Lion...?
_0.7287
Understood.
Mina says she will do it.
I've decided to cooperate as well.
_0.7290
Well, Mina, come with me.
Let's head to the ruins right away!
_0.7293
Yes!
I'll definitely look into treatments!
Please wait, Cheryl!
_0.7296
Mina...
Is it really okay?
_0.7301
When I found out that Mina was suffering in order to heal myself,
Because Cheryl will be angry. Please don't be reckless.
_0.7304
I'm not scared...I'm not scared...
That's not scary...!
_0.7309
We've arrived.
Shall we come in, Mina?
_0.7312
yes!
Please wait, Sheryl-san...!
_0.7315
Mina, are you okay? ?
_0.7318
Yes, it is okay.
let's go…….
_0.7321
I'm sorry, Mina, for making you push yourself too hard for Sheryl's sake...
_0.7324
Don't worry about it, Alto.
I just want to do my best for Sheryl.
_0.7327
I'm sorry... Please, Mina!
_0.7330
Mina, we'll be there soon.
Because I believe you can do it!
_0.7335
You've arrived.
If Cheryl could find a cure from this database...
_0.7340
It's okay, Leon.
To tell you the truth, it's a little scary, but
As long as you think it's to help Cheryl, it's okay!
_0.7343
Well, let's get started...
_0.7346
Yeah………….
_0.7349
...Endemic disease...Ouroboros fever...
_0.7352
Uro... Boros... Cactus...?
_0.7355
Uuu…! ! !
_0.7358
Mina!
Anything more is unreasonable!
_0.7361
Just a little more...!
_0.7364
I’m already so…sssssssssssss…! ! ! !
_0.7367
Mina! !
_0.7372
Mina! !
Hey! Are you okay, Mina? !
_0.7375
Or...Sith......to...
_0.7378
Is it the Ouroboros cactus from Oasis?
Well done, Mina!
_0.7381
Let's hurry...to the oasis...
_0.7384
Aisha can you hear me?
I found out the cure for Cheryl!
_0.7387
really! ?
_0.7390
Thanks to Mina's hard work.
There's a thing called "Ouroboros Cactus" in the oasis.
Apparently it's medicine.
_0.7393
Ouroboros cactus?
I've never heard of it.
I wonder if cacti from tens of thousands of years ago still exist today?
_0.7396
Well, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will remain as it is...
_0.7399
I have to believe that it exists now.
_0.7402
I'll send you the data on the drug manufacturing method, so I'll ask you to prepare it.
We're going to the oasis to get the raw material cactus!
_0.7405
Yeah! I got it!
_0.7408
...Ha, ha, ha...
_0.7411
Everyone... falls down...
_0.7414
Mina?
_0.7417
Father… Mother….
_0.7420
Hey! Mina!
_0.7423
Oh, oh, Leon?
What's happen?
_0.7426
No, it's nothing...
_0.7429
Mina's guy is pretty crazy.
I have to quickly find the cactus and return to the ship...!
_0.7432
...Whew.
_0.7435
what up?
_0.7438
Looks like you're a little tired...
I'm sorry at a time like this.
_0.7441
Mina, are you feeling okay?
I'm sorry for making you push yourself.
_0.7444
No, that's fine, Alto-san.
_0.7447
According to Mina, it should be in this oasis...!
_0.7450
Leon, isn't that it?
_0.7453
There seems to be no doubt about this.
_0.7456
Aisha, I got the ouroboros cactus!
I'll bring it home right away.
_0.7459
I got it.
So... how's Mina doing?
_0.7462
I'm sleeping now.
I guess he was exhausted from the link with the ruins...
_0.7465
You really tried your best, Mina.
Yeah...I'll be waiting for you to come home!
_0.7468
From ouroboros cactus,
I gave you the medicine I extracted.
_0.7471
I tried looking into it, but...
It had a decultural taste...
_0.7474
That medicine has such an amazing color.
_0.7477
It seems that cacti have evolved since the time when Mina was born.
I was saved because it still had efficacy against fever.
_0.7480
I think I'll wake up once the medicine takes effect...
_0.7483
………………?
_0.7486
Argh!
What, what is this! ?
The inside of my mouth...! Alto, water!
_0.7489
Sheryl, are you okay? ?
_0.7492
No, there's no way it's okay!
The inside of my mouth was sore, spicy, or rather painful...!
What are you doing absentmindedly? water!
_0.7495
Look, it's water.
Calm down and drink.
_0.7498
…Nng, ngu, ngu….
Phaaah! seconds! quickly!
_0.7501
Is it OK?
So, Sheryl, how's your fever...?
_0.7504
heat……? That's why the heat is in the mouth...!
fault? Why am I sleeping in bed?
_0.7507
Cheryl didn't collapse from a high fever.
We were so worried! ?
_0.7510
Was it so?
So maybe that super spicy thing you mentioned earlier is medicine?
_0.7513
It's a drug that works so well that I'm worried about its immediate effect.
Mina also researches the manufacturing method of medicine.
It was worth the effort.
_0.7516
Mina accesses the ruins database and
He researched the manufacturing method of the medicine.
Don't be reckless in order to get information.
_0.7519
Was it so…….
_0.7522
Mina-chan.
As a thank you, please let me listen to your songs again.
Please look forward to it!
_0.7525
Yes! I'm looking forward to it!
But you can't get out of bed just a little longer.
_0.7528
Now you can say it, Mina-chan...!
_0.7531
After all, I'm the oldest one.
You have to listen to what your elders say.
_0.7534
Hehe, thank you so much, Mina-chan.
_0.7537
...Um, is that okay?
_0.7540
What happened again?
_0.7543
Maybe it's something to discuss?
If so, please feel free to tell me.
_0.7546
Ah, but...when it comes to salary...
It would be helpful if you could refrain from doing that for a bit...
_0.7549
No, that's not true!
I'm not talking about salary, but actually, thanks to the database ruins,
I remembered something that happened a long time ago!
_0.7552
In the past...
_0.7555
Maybe it's from the ancient Ouroboros era! ?
_0.7558
...Let me hear it, Mina. All the good and bad.
Please rely on me a little bit, we are family.
_0.7563
The ancient Ouroboros era in which we lived,
It is the legacy of protoculture left on this planet.
He was trying to uncover the ruins and build a richer world.
_0.7566
Some ruins and technology are based on the imagination of fathers.
Apparently it was something extremely dangerous.
_0.7569
Something dangerous?
_0.7572
The ruins "Yurva Aga" are located in the center of this planet.
There was a biological weapon in a completely stopped state.
There was “Fold Evil”.
_0.7575
lie…….
Evil means the "Evil Series", right?
_0.7578
Protoculture is
An existence developed as a higher-ranking weapon than the Zentraedi.
_0.7581
The body was taken over by an energy life form,
It was called Protodeviln...
_0.7584
The fathers continue to investigate Evil.
We have discovered the abilities of the Yurva Aga ruins.
_0.7587
Its ability is ``transtemporal variation of events.''
_0.7590
``Transtemporal variation of events''...
Using fold space to change events...
That's what protoculture is...
_0.7593
What do you mean?
Please explain clearly.
_0.7596
That's right... Put simply,
It means you can change the past and the future.
_0.7599
Are you serious.
Is it possible to create the world at will?
With protoculture, anything is possible...
_0.7602
Mina, if I hadn't heard it from you, I wouldn't have believed it.
_0.7605
The ruins were sealed,
You activated it during the ancient Ouroboros era, right?
_0.7608
that's right. Fathers say it's dangerous to even touch them.
It seems that he appealed, but due to the egos of some people,
I activated Yrva Aga.
_0.7611
Then this world once,
Has it been recreated in the ancient Ouroboros era?
_0.7614
No, that's not true.
Whether you use Yurva Aga or completely stop it,
I lacked the energy to sing.
_0.7617
Because of that, the ruins start up unstable...
_0.7620
In order to stop the rampage, Mina went to sleep.
…and.
_0.7623
yes.
As I slept in those ruins,
I kept singing songs in my dreams.
_0.7626
Replenishes Yrva Aga with singing energy,
In order to stabilize it even a little...
_0.7629
Then, since I woke up Mina,
Does this mean that something strange has begun to happen on this planet?
_0.7632
No, even before Rion came, this planet had abnormal fold faults,
A phenomenon that deviates from the normal laws of physics was occurring.
Something strange would have happened even if Leon didn't come in contact with it.
_0.7635
Although it is a protoculture ruin,
It's been a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time.
_0.7638
My memory is vague, but I think so too.
A song for a complete stop People with energy
I had to keep waiting.
_0.7641
At that time, the singing energy necessary to stop Yurva Aga
I couldn't collect it.
That's why we need your help now!
_0.7644
Replenish, or activate, song energy at the six ruins,
Finally, we need to seal the Yurva Aga ruins.
_0.7647
yes.
The fathers are trying to seal away the rampaging Yurva Aga.
I put my hope in the future.
_0.7650
The time will surely come when all the people with strong singing energy will be together!
Even if it's impossible now, there is definitely hope for the future!
_0.7653
Dad says let's all protect what's important to us!
Let's restore peace to this planet!
_0.7656
I believe that now is the future!
Surely now...!
_0.7659
Ah, the future that Mina's father worked so hard to leave behind.
We have to live up to those expectations.
_0.7662
In fact, the ruins are still running smoothly.
If you keep going like this, everything will be OK!
_0.7665
Yes, please lend us your strength!
_0.7668
(The power of the ruins I heard from Mina.
Is it the power to create the past and future as you like? )
_0.7671
(Toudou and Havamar are also investigating the ruins,
Rod belongs to Havamar... )
_0.7674
(If you knew the power of the ruins...
Rod, maybe you have Mia... )
_0.7677
Leon, what's wrong with you being dazed?
_0.7680
yeah? Just a little.
Is it for me?
_0.7683
yes.
Thanks to the lack of jamming in the Sierra Desert,
Looks like Vanquish Race is restarting.
_0.7686
I thought Leon might be interested.
_0.7689
By the way, Vanquish from Ouroboros is
You said that the Sierra Desert is the most popular.
Certainly, I'm interested.
_0.7692
Then it was just right.
``The Man from the Past'' is a Vanquish Racer in Jurgen's Town
Apparently there's an amazing racer called ``.
_0.7695
A man from the past?
Maybe it's the guy who was called to the ruins! ?
_0.7698
I think so.
Like Alto, he might be joining the divas in this era.
Let's go see you.
_0.7701
It might be worth meeting.
in addition…….
_0.7704
in addition?
_0.7707
When you are told that you are an amazing pilot,
It's a bad habit of airplane passengers to wonder who's better than you.
Well then, let's go, Mina.
_0.7710
Now, let's leave for Jurgen's town.
_0.7713
yes!
I'm looking forward to Vanquish Race.
I'm getting excited.
_0.7716
A skilled Vanquish racer...
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of guy comes out.
_0.7719
Leon is also excited.
_0.7722
It's just a little bit, but Aruto is also a man from the past.
_0.7725
It was a little bad...!
_0.7728
Is that where you get angry?
Just because I came from the past,
I think that's pretty amazing...
_0.7731
Is this Jurgen's town?
_0.7734
How should I search?
_0.7737
The man from the past is a Vanquish racer.
For now, let's go to the race track.
There must be some information.
_0.7740
I agree.
Well then, let's go, Rion!
_0.7743
Are you Isamu Dyson?
I've heard many legends about you.
_0.7746
Honestly, I don't know what my future self would do.
I'm not really interested in it though.
_0.7749
I just fly how I want to fly.
Anytime, anywhere.
_0.7752
I really love the sky.
It's kind of cool.
_0.7755
Oh, you have an eye for men.
I wanted to meet my daughter in 5 years.
_0.7758
...I'll get to the point before Mina is wooed, but...
Like you, I'm with people who have transcended time.
Will you be our friend?
_0.7761
Hmm... suddenly it's the core.
The story is easy to understand.
However, it's boring to obediently listen to your requests.
_0.7764
You ride a Valkyrie, right?
Let's go simple.
_0.7767
Fight me in the Vanquish Race,
If you can convince me, we can become friends.
_0.7770
Heppoko pilot, then.
It's not worth it for me to be your friend.
Do you want to try a game?
_0.7773
Ever since I heard that there was a talented Vanquish racer,
Because I wanted to try it.
That's a good story line for me.
_0.7776
That means the negotiations have been concluded.
Well, I'll be waiting for you at the race track.
_0.7779
But please do your best!
Lion!
_0.7782
Ou!
As a Valkyrie rider, I can't afford to lose!
_0.7785
Ouroboros style rules are simple. Maybe you already know
All you have to do is "take" or "destroy" the specified number of targets to reach the goal.
Please entertain me?
_0.7788
That's my line.
It's a challenge!
_0.7791
Isn't there a problem with course A, which is a speed game?
_0.7794
Oh, I wish! !
_0.7797
So, are you ready?
_0.7800
3! 2! 1!
_0.7803
start! !
_0.7806
Wow!
Mr. Isamu, you are very skilled.
_0.7809
Damn it! As expected of the Roy Focker Award,
He is a legendary ace who has been awarded six times.
But I will definitely win!
_0.7812
It's not a bad skill.
But unfortunately, the aircraft doesn't follow that arm.
_0.7815
Good luck, Leon!
_0.7818
Chicksho!
I can't lose!
It would put a load on the aircraft, but there was nothing I could do!
_0.7821
Things are going well, Leon!
_0.7824
If it keeps going like this!
_0.7827
We're almost at the goal!
_0.7830
...Rion! ?
_0.7833
Damn it! Are you serious!
I guess I've let things go too far...
_0.7836
It means you'll have to retire partway through,
You can't accept how it ends, can you?
_0.7839
Ah... it can't end like this!
_0.7842
Phew, it looks like I made it in time...
_0.7845
Aisha! ?
Why are you here?
_0.7848
Hehehehe.
I came to take a look and also do a test.
_0.7851
I couldn't have asked for a better opponent than Isamu Dyson!
We have something special for you!
Come to the hangar right away!
_0.7854
Oh, hey!
_0.7857
Maybe this guy...! ?
_0.7860
Yeah, that's right.
This is the aircraft we are developing!
S. M. S's latest machine, YF-30 "Kronos"!
_0.7863
It's great that you made it this far on this ship.
_0.7866
Zentraedi's automated factory system and
The parts I've collected so far, and the gift of my own brain.
_0.7869
There were many other things that happened, not just this incident.
It was a perfect environment for fold fault research,
I was able to leave the guild work to Leon, so I managed to complete it.
_0.7872
So, is this guy ready to fly yet?
_0.7875
In theory.
I tried the simulation many times, but
In the end, I have to try flying it...
_0.7878
Well, that's what it is.
OK. Be prepared. The way I fly is rough.
_0.7881
Swing it around in a flashy way!
And please surprise Isamu Dyson! !
_0.7884
Before fighting with Isamu,
Maybe I should check the condition of YF-30...
_0.7889
So let's call it a test flight.
_0.7892
No, you don't need it.
Wait, Isamu!
I won't lose this time! !
_0.7895
law. This is again...
I've seen a lot of different aircraft since I came here,
Isn't that a brave look?
_0.7898
It doesn't matter. If only you could convince me.
_0.7901
Oh, I think I can entertain you.
Let them see my soul on Aisha's aircraft!
_0.7904
I understand your enthusiasm.
Now...just prove your skills!
_0.7907
Are you ready?
_0.7910
of course!
Sorry for making you wait.
_0.7913
A nice wind was blowing!
This one looks like it's going to be an interesting match!
_0.7916
So, are you ready?
_0.7923
goal!
_0.7926
Damn it!
_0.7929
With that kind of ability, I can't lend you my strength.
If you're still going, why don't we have one more match?
_0.7932
Of course, I'll have to play with you one more time!
I can still do it!
_0.7935
No matter how many times I try, my victory will never waver!
I like your enthusiasm!
_0.7938
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo so much !
_0.7941
How about this! !
_0.7944
Huh!
That's pretty easy to do, isn't it? You passed.
_0.7947
As promised, even if we become friends...
_0.7950
yeah?
An aircraft approaching here?
This guy…!
_0.7953
The target was acquired. Secure it.
_0.7956
I understand, even if I don't have to say it over and over again.
_0.7959
I will complete any mission for Ranka.
_0.7962
That's what I thought, but I'll talk about that later!
_0.7965
eh!
Why! ?
_0.7968
Even if I lightly estimate, one company is approaching.
_0.7971
Is that...Havamar?
They're special forces from the New Joint Forces, they're not the enemy.
_0.7974
You idiot!
Do you think those guys are sheriffs? ?
Those guys...!
_0.7977
...!
Hey, are you serious...! ?
_0.7980
Let the battle begin!
_0.7983
Shooting without warning! ?
_0.7986
Yeah... this!
_0.7989
From Antares 1 to Chalice 1.
Target acquired at point 723.
_0.7992
Antares 1, don't let your guard down.
If that YF-19 pilot was a man I knew,
He's more dangerous than a reaction bullet.
_0.7995
...? Me from Cyber Grant,
Although it is a prototype, you ride a brain-connected Valkyrie and team up.
An enemy that cannot be defeated?
_0.7998
That means there is a possibility.
_0.8001
Although you are an employee of Galaxy,
Don't you believe in our technology?
_0.8004
There is a difference between believing and clinging to wishful delusions.
I was like that too when I was a kid.
But reality starts with acknowledging it.
_0.8007
If it's reality, I recognize it. The old YF-19
It is impossible to defeat this VF-27 “Lucifer”.
Antares 1 begins the attack!
_0.8010
Tsk!
That aircraft...there's no doubt about it, it's Garudo's octopus!
Whatever you like, you shake your ass at those guys!
_0.8013
Do you know! ?
_0.8016
ah. That guy is Garde Gore Bowman.
Although it's a lot lower than me,
He's definitely the second best in the galaxy.
_0.8020
Omega 1, target acquired.
It's an aircraft that isn't registered.
_0.8023
...That's a good arm. Not as good as Isamu's guy, but
He is a bold pilot who defies theory.
Raise the BDI connection rate to 80, let's get serious...!
_0.8026
What a pilot!
You reacted too quickly...!
_0.8029
Brella! It's me!
Why are you attacking us? ?
_0.8032
Alto Saotome is a man who is always carried away by his emotions.
Their current mission is to capture Isamu Dyson.
_0.8035
It's not that I recognize you as the enemy.
However, he shows no mercy to those who stand in his way.
_0.8038
You won't listen!
You're still a snail!
_0.8041
VF-27 releases all weapons.
Shoot down the target.
_0.8044
...It came around before I knew it! ?
As expected, it's a Cyber Grant exclusive aircraft!
_0.8047
But this is also Aisha's secret weapon!
With the latest power...!
_0.8050
What? !
_0.8053
what is it!
When something breaks down like this, hey!
_0.8056
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Because Leon, are you okay? !
_0.8059
Kuuuu... it's not okay!
_0.8062
AAIEEEEEE!
_0.8065
Damn it!
What a number of missiles! !
I can't dodge it! ! !
_0.8068
Guaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! !
_0.8071
Oh no!
It looks like the tail has been damaged! !
_0.8074
Kuuu... it's not okay!
what will you do! ?
_0.8077
What the hell are you doing!
You said Leon!
It's a nuisance when Chintara is flying around!
_0.8080
Take that girl and run!
It seems like they're after me!
_0.8083
However, that aircraft in the lead is the latest model VF-27!
It's a monster whose brain is connected to a cyborg!
_0.8086
What should a Valkyrie rider do if he gets scared by a machine?
Anyway, I'll stop them!
_0.8089
But!
_0.8092
I told you to run away quickly!
_0.8095
Oh, by the way,
There's something I have to tell you.
_0.8098
I once met someone who was in a similar situation to me.
He should be near the bird-shaped rock.
_0.8101
For now, I have conveyed what I needed to convey.
Go quickly!
_0.8104
Lion!
What to do! ?
_0.8107
...I have no choice but to do as Isamu says!
Even if we fight like this, nothing will be done about that number.
_0.8110
But Mr. Isamu! ?
_0.8113
I will round this up appropriately and leave.
My cutie's acceleration is incredible.
That's it, the communication is over!
_0.8116
Please run away...!
Having said that, I don't know what will happen here...!
_0.8119
If I pull this far apart, will anything work?
They are really chicks who need a lot of attention...!
_0.8122
Surrender, Isamu Dyson.
There is no escape from this VF-27.
_0.8125
Even if!
I have no intention of becoming your prisoner!
_0.8128
It is judged that it is difficult to carry out the current operation.
The strategy shifts from capture to shooting down.
_0.8131
Fall!
_0.8134
Tsk... I was clumsy...!
_0.8137
As long as the aircraft is properly maintained,
It shouldn't have been such a hassle!
_0.8140
Chicksho!
_0.8143
Confirmed that Isamu Dyson was shot down.
I'll be returning from now on.
_0.8146
Are you okay! ?
Leon, Mina! !
_0.8149
Ah, somehow.
_0.8152
I'm sorry, but my YF-30 was still unfinished.
I put myself in danger...
And Isamu too...
_0.8155
Don't worry, Aisha.
Isamu isn't the type of person who can be defeated easily.
_0.8160
That's right...
...That's what you say when you flew with Isamu.
I'll believe those words.
_0.8163
And the guy who killed Isamu,
Is Alto's acquaintance someone from the past?
_0.8166
Ah, Brela Stern.
He's the agent who was my bodyguard.
_0.8169
Damn it!
What on earth is that guy from Brella trying to do?
_0.8172
He said it was for Ranka, but
After all, Ranka has also come to this era...?
_0.8175
There are so many things I really don't understand.
Why did Havamar do such a thing...?
_0.8178
Apparently Havamar too.
It seems that they are in contact with the people who were called to the ruins.
So, the purpose is...
_0.8181
...I guess it's a ruin.
I'll try contacting Commander Todo for a moment.
_0.8184
Come to think of it, it's YF-30.
I'll disassemble it once and review the design around the engine from scratch.
_0.8187
Because we placed too much emphasis on power efficiency, we had problems with durability.
Next time, we will increase the accuracy of the simulation even more.
I'll make it into a perfect aircraft!
_0.8190
Can you ride it again during the practical test?
_0.8193
of course!
I'm looking forward to seeing it completed.
_0.8196
It seems that Havamar is also planning something,
I won't be able to repay the debt you owe me!
_0.8199
I tried contacting Commander Todo, but...
I couldn't ask for help because I was busy.
_0.8202
The smell was gradually getting worse.
That's why I'm going to attack Havamar base.
I can't help it...I don't know what to do...
_0.8205
In that case, Isamu said,
Why not look for rocks shaped like birds?
The person we are looking for is there. That's what he said.
_0.8208
I think there was a rock shaped like that,
As for what Isamu was talking about,
I just don't understand.
_0.8211
It'll be exhausting, but I have no choice but to investigate.
_0.8214
To improve search efficiency,
Alto and Sheryl are investigating as separate units.
I'm thinking of getting it, is it okay?
_0.8219
It would be nice to go on a flight date with Alto once in a while.
Well then, I'll go.
_0.8222
Okay, then we too.
Let's go find a bird-shaped rock!
_0.8225
As for the person we're looking for,
Does that mean she's a diva after all?
_0.8228
I hope so...
He said he was in the same situation as Isamu.
It doesn't necessarily mean that you have the energy to sing.
_0.8231
...It doesn't seem like it's around here.
_0.8234
It would be better to look elsewhere.
_0.8237
Maybe it's different here...
_0.8240
Let's search steadily!
_0.8243
I can't find it anywhere.
_0.8246
Where is it?...
_0.8249
Damn it, where is it?
_0.8252
I don't get irritated, I don't get irritated.
Let's keep calm and look for it.
_0.8255
Lion!
Take your time and look around!
_0.8258
Understood!
_0.8261
Check the footage from above.
This rock might resemble a bird...
_0.8264
Is this the rock Isamu was talking about?
I'll investigate.
_0.8267
fault?
It's rare for people to come to a place like this.
Is it of any use?
_0.8270
Actually, I'm looking for someone...
Ah, how should I explain?
_0.8273
Looking for someone...?
Maybe it's about that older sister?
_0.8276
older sister?
_0.8279
A woman from a foreign country had settled here.
Even though I told her to come to town, she was adamant that she wouldn't go...
By the way, I wonder where you went?
_0.8282
...Apparently that's the one...
The guy Isamu was trying to get us to meet.
So, there seems to be no doubt about it.
_0.8285
Didn't your sister say anything?
_0.8288
Hmm...I guess...
It's like what Kadun said about the ruins...
_0.8291
Ruins?
Is there no doubt that she is a diva after all?
_0.8294
Leon, I'm sorry but I'm in the middle of looking for someone.
A new ruin has been discovered.
Can I have you shift to investigating ruins?
_0.8297
understood. I got the information, though.
It seems like he's not there right now.
Let's come see you again later.
_0.8300
Yeah, let's do that.
_0.8303
I couldn't meet the person I wanted, but
Apparently the person Isamu taught me about is a diva.
_0.8306
Looks like it.
Let's go ask them to help us again next time.
_0.8309
Lion!
Look at that!
_0.8312
what?
Is it a dispute between the Zentraedi?
_0.8315
I can't afford to just ignore this.
I can't seem to get through the conversation, so I'll ask you to calm down a bit.
_0.8318
It's no good, you're completely beside yourself.
It seems like we have to do something about it...
_0.8321
Is this...a song? ?
_0.8324
I can not believe it.
It's directly interrupting the fold communication...!
_0.8327
O great man descending from heaven.
Purify the angry Kadun.
If you hear this voice, please calm down that sadness...
_0.8330
W-what! ?
What were we doing! ?
_0.8333
My heart was buzzing, but it disappeared somewhere.
It's my first time hearing a song like this...!
_0.8336
Did you stop the Zentraedi's rampage with song?
Could it be that the diva Isamu was talking about?
_0.8339
Is there anything I can do?
You who have a very strange soul color.
_0.8342
Do you know Isamu?
That's why I asked about you...
_0.8345
...Isamu?
_0.8348
Looks like it's bingo.
My name is Rion Sakaki.
I'm gathering divas to solve the strange situation on this planet.
_0.8351
I'm Sarah Noem.
As the guide of the wind, I felt the rustling wind.
_0.8354
Sarah...My name is Mina!
I would like you to help me start up the ruins!
_0.8357
...I came to this strange land because...
Is this your guidance?
_0.8360
No, I didn't choose it.
I think the ruins chose Sarah.
_0.8363
...then let's leave it that way.
If there is anything I can do, I will help you.
_0.8366
Thank you, Sarah!
_0.8369
We cannot let the world hear the song of destruction.
Let's go quickly.
_0.8372
By the way, why was Sarah there?
_0.8375
By the message from the god of wind,
He was heading towards the ruins to do what he had to do.
_0.8378
Does that mean he knows why he was called to the ruins?
Being a wind guide is amazing.
_0.8381
Is it here...?
_0.8384
yes. From now on, I will link to the ruins.
Sarah thinks about her loved ones.
please sing…….
_0.8387
Dear people...I understand.
_0.8390
(Mao…. Shin….)
_0.8393
Sarah's song touches me...
_0.8398
It has started.
_0.8401
It seems like my role is now over.
_0.8404
I understand Sarah's feelings.
_0.8407
This is the third one, and there are three more left.
_0.8410
Okay, the ruins are starting up smoothly.
Well then, I guess I'll go back to the ship.
Can I have Sarah come with me?
_0.8413
Well, this is probably also guided by the wind.
_0.8416
Well, by the way, to Alto and the others,
I have to report that I activated the ruins.
_0.8419
alto,
We found the diva and completed the activation of the ruins.
I'll return to Gefion.
_0.8424
What, I was also heading towards the ruins.
It's already finished starting up.
Well then, we'll go back to the ship first.
_0.8427
Activating the ruins means that
The person I was looking for was a diva after all.
_0.8430
Ah, there's a shrine maiden named Sarah Nome.
You activated the ruins properly.
_0.8433
eh! Sarah Nome! ?
Maybe that's it....
_0.8436
Lion!
Hurry and bring that person back!
Rapidly! right away! right now! !
_0.8439
What's wrong with suddenly panicking, Cheryl?
_0.8442
Sarah Noem...
She's my grandma's older sister!
_0.8445
Ha! ? What did you say?
_0.8448
…grandmother?
_0.8451
What does it mean to be a grandma?
I look old enough to have grandchildren...!
_0.8454
Well, that's not the case.
It seems like it won't work unless I explain it from scratch.
_0.8457
Lion!
I brought Cheryl!
_0.8460
This is a world 50 years in the future from when I lived! ?
The Earth was destroyed by those who came from beyond the sea of stars...! ?
_0.8463
Well, you might be surprised, but it's all true.
I'm not from this era either.
_0.8468
When the sun rose over the Mayan Sea and a rainbow formed a snake,
The human soul transcends time and the stars to show us what we should accomplish.
_0.8471
If this is the guidance of the Mayan sun,
It may even be possible for future blood relatives to appear in front of me.
_0.8474
got it.
Let me go with you as a guide of the wind.
It seems that the reason why I came here still remains.
_0.8477
I don't really understand what you mean, to be honest.
If you'd like to lend me a hand, I'd appreciate it.
_0.8480
Well, I welcome all of you.
_0.8483
By the way, what kind of relationship do you have with Isamu?
_0.8486
For Isamu,
When I was about to be kidnapped by someone,
I got help.
_0.8489
That person is rough and violent,
I felt that there was a good spirit with me that read the mind of the wind.
I hope we can meet again someday.
_0.8492
Well, even if I killed him, I couldn't see him dying.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
_0.8495
Well, she's my grandma's older sister.
Grandma Sarah is fine, right?
_0.8498
Good luck, Grandma Sarah!
_0.8501
Please stop that...Grandma.
_0.8504
In that case, can I call you Sarah?
I want you to call me Sheryl too!
_0.8507
...I see, he is definitely Mao's grandson.
Well, that's fine.
_0.8510
Thank you for your help, Cheryl.
_0.8513
And Cheryl...
You have the right to inherit the guide of the wind.
There seems to be a lack of awareness.
_0.8516
Of course we...are you listening properly?
Cheryl?
_0.8519
Rion, I'm going to Creef Town to do some shopping.
Can you come with me?
_0.8522
No problem.
I also had something I wanted to buy.
_0.8525
that….
_0.8528
What's wrong, Sarah?
_0.8531
...Can I take you with me too?
_0.8534
Well, of course I don't mind.
_0.8537
It was the first time I went outside of the island...
To be honest, I don't know anything about life on this ship...
_0.8540
At least a little bit of civilization in the outside world,
I feel like I have to understand that.
_0.8543
Then I'll show you around.
Let's leave immediately.
_0.8546
Oh, wait a minute, Sheryl.
_0.8549
...I'm gone.
_0.8552
How are you planning to go...
Wait a minute, Sheryl.
_0.8555
I kindly request you.
_0.8558
I don't mind if you make it more comfortable.
_0.8561
Going shopping with Sarah?
I can not believe it….
_0.8564
From my point of view, it's unbelievable,
I'm kind of getting used to the scary stuff.
_0.8567
Are you heading to town now?
_0.8570
Even so,
I feel like the atmosphere is quite different from yesterday...
_0.8573
I'm not used to this kind of thing so I'm nervous!
I don't feel at ease...
_0.8576
It's okay, Sarah!
Because I and everyone else are together!
_0.8579
Now, that's the destination, Creef Town.
Let's enjoy shopping.
_0.8582
Yes, yes. thank you.
_0.8585
This is...the city...!
I've seen it in pictures, but
There's so much electric light...!
_0.8588
If anything,
In Ouroboros, it is a town that belongs to the countryside.
_0.8591
This is the countryside...! ?
I-Is that so...!
_0.8594
In the village where I was born,
There was only one thing that produced electric light.
_0.8597
Even so, with just one generator running,
The light of the stars has been taken away from us.
Everything here is different from the world I know...
_0.8600
If that's the case, you should know it now.
Everything is an experience. Now, let's go.
_0.8603
you…….
He really does look like Mao...
_0.8606
song……!
_0.8609
Sara….
You and I were born in different places and grew up in different countries.
But through songs, we can understand each other. That's not it?
_0.8612
Song connects the sky and the sea, washes away sadness,
Something that allows spirits to play among humans.
That doesn't change even at the end of the sea of stars...
_0.8615
...Hey, hey, what does that mean?
_0.8618
The value of a song is the same no matter what era it is.
True art can be understood in any country.
...I guess it was my father's favorite phrase.
_0.8621
Songs connect everyone...
I think that's really wonderful.
_0.8624
That's right.
The way we met was a little special, but
This is the bond that was created thanks to the song.
_0.8627
And we're not done yet.
We must continue to work together and do our best.
_0.8630
And to further deepen our bond, I will continue to buy more!
Everyone, let's go! !
_0.8633
So, are you still going to buy it, Aisha?
Please give me a break...
_0.8636
Phew, I've finally calmed down.
Let's have some tea and take a break.
_0.8639
………?
_0.8642
What happened?
Didn't you like the tea?
_0.8645
No, I think it's a very delicious tea...
I feel bad Kadun.
A purple and black Kadun that takes shape from people's muddy selfishness...
_0.8648
Kadun?
I say that sometimes, but what do you mean?
_0.8651
Kadun can only be described as Kadun.
_0.8654
Curses and evil spirits...
Well, you can think of it as a concept of disaster.
I read about it in Dr. Mao's paper.
_0.8657
It's called kegare in Japanese.
It is said that a shrine maiden exorcises injury through song and dance.
It's no wonder Sarah has that kind of power.
_0.8660
So what happened to that Kadun?
_0.8663
I can feel Kadun from the water here.
_0.8666
From the water?
I'm sure there is a large underground water vein beneath this city.
It should have been extracted from there...?
_0.8669
It seems that some evil person is plotting something bad underground.
_0.8672
……Are you serious.
_0.8675
Leon, let's do some research.
_0.8678
Okay. Let's head to the underground water vein.
_0.8681
Are there any protective weapons in places like this?
I guess it's better to think of it as an anomaly.
_0.8684
A protective weapon?
What is this machine?
_0.8687
It's a weapon that protects the ruins.
Actually, I don't know anything else.
_0.8690
I don't feel Kadun from this machine...
_0.8693
Is this the entrance to the underground water vein?
_0.8696
Recently, I found signs that someone had broken into the house.
As Sarah said, there seems to be something going on.
_0.8699
If you go deeper, you'll understand everything.
_0.8702
Kadun is flowing through the water.
_0.8705
It's in the back...
_0.8708
what? !
You heard something just now! !
_0.8711
What, Rion?
Maybe you're scared?
_0.8714
There's no way!
You have a stronger voice!
_0.8717
Well, that's not true!
_0.8720
Don't you two fight anymore.
I'll go inside.
_0.8723
Mina's guy has quite a bit of courage...
_0.8726
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa! !
_0.8729
W-w-what happened? !
_0.8732
Hey, I saw a strange shadow!
_0.8735
Shadow? What is it?
_0.8738
It must be my imagination! ?
_0.8741
I want you to hurry up...?
_0.8744
Let's go quickly!
Come on, Rion, go ahead!
_0.8747
Hey you guys, what are you doing there!
_0.8750
Hey, you found it!
But once you set up the bomb, the rest is...!
_0.8753
It's a bomb! ?
Why would you do that!
_0.8756
We pollute the nature of this planet,
The rotten people who are only interested in developing weapons,
Banish it from Ouroboros!
_0.8759
How selfish!
In order to protect only the nature that is convenient for us,
Are you trying to kill people and pollute the earth?
_0.8762
For a good cause, a little sacrifice is unavoidable.
Justice cannot be achieved without shedding blood!
_0.8765
I don't know about your justice!
I don't do things that cause trouble to people.
I don't accept that it's justice!
_0.8768
Despite what the bomb said,
Where is it?
_0.8771
Lion!
I can feel the fire coming from there!
_0.8774
You're absolutely right.
There is certainly a bomb here, but
I can't let you release it that easily!
_0.8777
Korra!
It’s you again! !
You always get in my way every time! !
_0.8780
Come on!
And even Gunness is reluctant!
_0.8783
A person possessed by the arrogant Kadun!
I don't understand why there is no point in doing something like this!
_0.8786
There is no meaning in the first place!
As long as I can enjoy it, that's all I need!
Look, if you don't hurry, the bomb will explode, right?
_0.8789
That's no use, Sarah.
Unfortunately, there are some people who just don't understand.
Let's call this an exercise of strength!
_0.8792
What, is it like this?
Come on, get serious! !
_0.8795
As you wish, I will do it! !
_0.8798
Hmm... it's time to pull up.
_0.8801
Hey!
Listen, you guys!
Brother Kamjin, Harva...
_0.8804
…Ganeth, keep your mouth shut.
_0.8807
Sorry!
_0.8810
let's go!
_0.8813
Phew...the bomb has been defused.
This doesn't seem to be a problem.
_0.8816
That man named Kamjin...
It had the color of a mysterious soul.
Maybe he's not just a bad guy.
_0.8819
I thought I was going shopping, but
I never expected that I would have to fight against Kamjin and the others...
_0.8822
Lion.
When you say there are people who don't understand,
I said it earlier.
_0.8825
……ah.
_0.8828
With that in mind, someday you too,
They will be swallowed up by the same arrogant Kadun.
_0.8831
The sadness inside you
I hope that this will serve as a catalyst for that.
_0.8834
It was back when I was a kid that I thought I could change anything with my power.
Taka knows what can happen with missiles.
I think it's Sarah's songs that are truly powerful.
_0.8837
What can we do with ruins, what can we do with time and space?
That's not what's important.
I think it's something more fundamental. Trust me on that.
_0.8840
The wind blowing from you
A little sad and very warm.
_0.8843
It somehow resembles the Mayan style...
_0.8846
Very, very, very bad!
Lion-chan! !
_0.8849
What are you doing in such a hurry, Leeron?
_0.8852
In the Sierra Desert,
A lot of bandits are running wild!
_0.8855
In defiance of the New Joint Forces that came to suppress it,
Desne is in a lot of trouble.
_0.8858
The bandits go on a rampage all at once.
I can't believe something like this could happen by chance...
_0.8861
Well, it's Kamjin.
It looks like you've been making a lot of preparations in advance.
_0.8864
It doesn't matter who caused it now, Death Dakara,
Please subdue the rampaging bandits!
_0.8867
What is Havamar doing?
Special forces for situations like this, right?
_0.8870
That's why I can't contact you.
Todo-kun, what are you doing at such an important time? !
_0.8873
You can't rely on Havamar.
Either way, it's not something you can overlook!
Leave it to me, Leeron.
_0.8876
I asked for it!
Lion-chan.
_0.8879
I received the data, but
It's really rampaging throughout the Sierra Desert.
_0.8882
I'll clean it up from scratch!
_0.8885
Found a band of bandits.
Exterminate!
_0.8888
Well then, let's start
_0.8891
Let's finish it quickly.
_0.8893
Don't think you can run away from me
_0.8896
I'll clean it up quickly.
_0.8899
Leeron will contact you.
It seems the mastermind behind this incident has been found.
_0.8902
I found it surprisingly quickly.
Then leave Kamjin alone,
Let's stop this nonsense!
_0.8905
After all, he really only causes trouble to people!
_0.8908
Bandit King,
This Ganesu-sama will be your opponent! !
_0.8911
So, Gunness! ?
You were the mastermind! !
_0.8914
What a joke.
I can't believe Gunness has the power to do this much.
I don't think there is, but...
_0.8917
How can you afford to talk about it?
Hurry up and pick me up, Korra! !
_0.8920
I can't read the situation, but
First of all, we have to do something about Ganeth's bastard!
_0.8923
Gunness, what are you doing?
_0.8926
Like I'm doing it,
I guess you're just saying he's acting wild! !
_0.8929
Another thing I don't understand...!
_0.8932
Hey, are you still playing Gunness?
_0.8935
There is so much!
I'm not the kind of guy to give up in a place like this! !
_0.8938
What's wrong with you, Gunness?
Normally, if it got dangerous, I would run away right away...!
_0.8941
yeah?
Confirm the approaching aircraft?
Enemy reinforcements? ?
_0.8944
Come on! ?
_0.8947
You have some guts, Gunness!
But this time it was too much.
I, as Havamar, will kill you!
_0.8950
What does Havamar mean? ?
_0.8953
Well, I'm here to help.
Be grateful, you guys.
_0.8956
What is going to happen...?
_0.8959
Me,
I hate people who cause trouble to people the most!
_0.8962
H-heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! !
_0.8965
...Isn't that really Kamjin?
_0.8968
Yeah... that's supposed to be the case...
_0.8971
That's it, Gunness.
_0.8974
Damn it! ! !
_0.8977
Hehe, things went well, brother.
Now the guys from Havamar...!
_0.8980
Don't talk too much.
_0.8983
Take him away quickly!
_0.8986
Hey, it's going to happen to me in Havamar.
It was such an easy win.
_0.8989
Hey, how did you come to Havamar?
I belonged! ?
_0.8992
What are you saying?
I've been a member ever since I came to this era.
As a well-behaved soldier!
_0.8995
What are you talking about?
You've done a lot of bad things!
_0.8998
I don't understand what you mean.
I'm busy, let me go home.
_0.9001
That Kamjin guy must be planning something...
I kept shouting Havamar's name.
_0.9004
For now, I was able to put down the bandit riot.
Please come back to the ship once.
_0.9007
I heard that Kamzin belonged to Havamar.
What's going on...
_0.9010
There is a possibility that Kamjin is lying,
The Havamar soldiers were also with us,
It doesn't seem like it's a lie.
_0.9013
I have no idea what I wanted to do.
Gunness didn't understand either...
_0.9016
And above all, what does Havamar want?
_0.9019
I'm making that Kamjin belong to me.
There's definitely something going on behind the scenes.
_0.9022
It's an organization with so much power.
I can't imagine him revealing his full purpose easily.
_0.9025
I can't help it, all I can do for now is
Is it just a matter of understanding Havamar's movements?
_0.9028
I'll also contact Leeron to make sure he has the information.
_0.9031
...For the same purpose as this one.
It doesn't seem like you're investigating ruins.
this is….
_0.9034
Sorry, Lion-chan.
This is also about Havamar.
I don't have any information.
_0.9037
Really.
Please contact me if you have any information.
_0.9040
I understand.
_0.9043
It seems like we didn't get any good information.
What are you planning to do now?
_0.9046
I guess I'll just have to wait.
I feel like I'm too far behind...
_0.9049
Lion!
I've received a strange message!
_0.9052
communication?
Military compressed laser communications.
Are they being sent unilaterally from some base?
_0.9055
...Can you hear me, S. M. S?
This is...Point 386, Havamar Base...!
_0.9058
It's Havamar base! ?
_0.9061
Grace! ?
_0.9066
You're my manager.
...And the intelligence officer of the Macross Galaxy fleet...
_0.9069
Ranka-san is also captured here...
Based on the data you sent...rescue...!
_0.9072
Ranka-chan and Grace...!
_0.9075
Could it be a trap?
_0.9078
If it's a trap, use Ranka Lee, which will definitely bite you.
I think it's a theory.
_0.9081
That's right.
And this code definitely belongs to Grace.
_0.9084
Then there's no reason to hesitate.
If Ranka is here, I have to rescue her!
_0.9087
I understand.
As soon as we're ready, let's head over to them.
_0.9090
No matter what you say about the evidence, it's not a good question.
I don't know the purpose of Havamar, but
It looks like you're thinking something stupid!
_0.9093
Please be sure to help Ranka-chan and Grace.
Lion!
_0.9096
The target is Havamar base.
The defense network isn't half bad.
Be careful of the aerial cannons!
_0.9099
An interceptor has departed from Havamar base!
be careful!
_0.9102
Brera, do you understand?
_0.9107
Confirm the target and begin interception.
_0.9110
Brella! !
_0.9113
Alto Saotome.
Sorry, but it's for Ranka. Let me crash.
_0.9116
For Ranka?
Brella, I didn't expect it to be you...
_0.9119
There are a lot of complicated things going on here as well.
I will not show mercy!
_0.9122
It's about time.
_0.9125
Ah, that's right...it's about time.
_0.9128
Command, this is Omega 1.
Damage to the BDI system and Antares 1's Cyberlink.
I will withdraw from this.
_0.9131
What! ?
You guys can still fight!
_0.9134
As we have reported, the BDI system is extremely unstable.
If the battle continues with the system damaged,
There is a risk of a runaway.
_0.9137
If you get involved in that accident and lose Ranka Lee,
I think it's you guys, Havamar, who are in trouble?
_0.9140
This self-diagnosis also supports Chief Bowman's view.
May I have permission to withdraw?
_0.9143
It is unavoidable...!
I'll deal with them. You guys should retreat!
_0.9146
appreciate.
Omega 1 and Antares 1 leave combat airspace!
_0.9149
...It looks like you pulled me up.
Those guys, by any chance?
_0.9152
Ah, I think so.
The guy from Brera isn't very good at acting.
_0.9155
Well, I can roughly understand the situation.
Well then, I'll take advantage of their strategy,
I'll do a spectacular rampage inside the base!
_0.9158
Can you hear me? This is Grace O'Connor.
Now, in the system of Havamar base,
I sent a virus.
_0.9161
Wow! ?
Are you Cheryl's manager?
Where on earth are you communicating from?
_0.9164
Don't make unnecessary noise.
Until Ranka-san's rescue operation is over, you guys...
Please attract the enemy as a man.
_0.9167
Leave it to me!
That's why I asked for Ranka Lee.
_0.9170
Not yet! ?
_0.9173
Understood!
_0.9175
They're desperately looking for it too.
Let's go wild and wild!
_0.9178
Is this the limit to how much time I can buy?
Now I have no choice but to trust them.
_0.9181
Lion! !
_0.9186
Looks like he was able to do whatever he wanted at someone else's base!
_0.9189
I have something for fun.
Warii interrupted me just a little bit.
_0.9192
Why are you getting in my way? !
_0.9195
You use the power of the ruins,
Because they are trying to distort history!
_0.9198
Rion, do you think you have the power of the ruins...?
_0.9201
Oh, and what you want too!
_0.9206
Rod, you will use the power of the ruins to create the world where Mia is...
Trying to bring Mia back to life...!
_0.9209
Phew, hahahahaha! !
Even though you understand my purpose, are you still trying to get in my way?
You! !
_0.9212
What you are trying to do is wrong!
If we did that, what would the world be like now? ?
_0.9215
noisy!
I don't care what the world would be like without Mia! !
For me, there would be no world without Mia...!
_0.9220
Rion, if you get in my way, I'll have you die here!
_0.9223
Stop it, Rod!
_0.9226
I will create the world I want! !
With Commander Todo! !
_0.9229
Tch, I guess I have no choice but to do it.
I can't fight properly here.
I have to escape from the base once!
_0.9232
If only I had the power of the ruins,
Earth will no longer be destroyed by the Zentraedi!
Isn't that wonderful!
_0.9235
different!
You just want a world where Mia is alive!
_0.9238
What's wrong with that! ?
_0.9241
The galaxy is full of tragedies like the one where we lost Mia...
This is Commander Todo's plan to prevent that tragedy from happening again!
_0.9244
The power of the ruins is the power to manipulate time and space.
With that power, we won't be afraid of the past anymore!
Reshape the world and create a future for humanity!
_0.9247
Do not be silly!
There is no way such a convenient world exists!
Do you think Mia will be happy if you destroy the current world? !
_0.9250
Lion, you aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ! !
_0.9253
Rodoooooooooo! !
_0.9256
Even if you deny my way of life,
I will push forward on this path for Mia!
_0.9259
Rod, you...!
_0.9262
If you're going to get in my way, fall down!
Lion! !
_0.9267
What...? !
_0.9270
You!
_0.9273
I rescued Ranka safely.
Siegfried 1, thank you for your cooperation.
_0.9276
Phew.
That's ridiculous, it's taking too long.
_0.9279
Lion!
To buy you some time...!
_0.9282
Alto-kun!
You really are Alto!
_0.9285
Ranka!
I'm glad you are fine….
_0.9288
Damn it!
A mechanical doll look!
What do you do with a body that is poorly maintained?
_0.9291
Unfortunately, we're not very good pilots either.
We don't just rely on high technology.
I'm determined to have enough willpower to repay my debt to you guys!
_0.9294
Garde Gore Bowman!
Myung Fan Loon is still in our hands...!
_0.9297
know! !
_0.9300
...But you guys can't kill Myun.
If the plan presented by Ms. Grace is true,
You guys should never be able to hurt Myun.
_0.9303
That woman is so...!
_0.9306
Rod Baltomer doesn't have the personality to be an intelligence officer.
Apparently it's true.
_0.9309
Brera, who recaptured the hostages, and I, who made a new vow to recapture Mune,
There is no reason to obey your orders anymore!
_0.9312
That's right!
You guys acted like you were taking my sister hostage.
I'm sorry!
_0.9315
Siegfried 1!
Me and Omega 1 will control the sky.
You must drop “Parzival”!
_0.9318
Antares 1, thank you!
_0.9321
Damn it! ! !
_0.9324
Following the second unit, the fourth unit will be destroyed!
Damn, why is this happening...!
_0.9327
The reason is simple.
It's because I betrayed you!
_0.9332
It wasn't fun being under you guys either.
Wari, I'll cut you off here.
_0.9335
Unusually, I thought it worked as ordered,
Was it to catch us off guard...!
_0.9338
That's okay.
There's no way you would sell me out!
_0.9341
Well then, I've been taken care of so far.
Bye.
_0.9344
Damn... Kamjin!
But we have to protect the base!
_0.9347
Enough about that, abandon the base in the Sierra Desert.
_0.9350
command! but…!
_0.9353
rod….
I can't afford to lose you.
Also for my plans.
_0.9356
…I got it.
_0.9359
Abandon base and retreat!
Everyone, please act according to Code 30!
_0.9362
Wait, Rod!
_0.9365
What is the meaning of a world without Mia?
Leon, I think you should think about the path you should take again.
_0.9368
Rodoooooooooo! ! !
_0.9371
Leon, don't push yourself too hard!
_0.9374
Damn... Understood!
_0.9377
Rod...why are you so...
_0.9380
Grace is also safe.
_0.9383
Well, I'm glad you're okay too.
_0.9386
It's bad that I'm so happy to see you again,
May I ask you to introduce yourself?
At least we were talking over the phone.
_0.9389
Well, I'm sorry for being late in introducing myself.
I'm Grace O'Connor.
I'm Cheryl's manager.
_0.9392
Did the manager hack the New Joint Forces base?
_0.9395
I have implants all over my body.
When it comes to information processing ability, I can't lose to anyone.
_0.9398
…and a galaxy intelligence officer,
Colonel Grace Godunuwa even has a title.
_0.9401
Grace Godunwa...! ?
He is also the successor of Dr. Mao Nome! ?
_0.9404
Hehe, there are many things, Branch Manager Aisha.
More details later...
_0.9407
Now, it would be a good idea to ask others to introduce you.
This is the planet Eden about 20 years ago.
The chief in charge of the development of the YF-21.
_0.9410
Garde Gore Bowman.
Who do you know about Isamu Dyson?
It's what's called a kusare-en.
_0.9413
Isamu is not the kind of guy who would die even if he was killed.
Rather, my friend Myung van Loon
Captured by Havamar.
_0.9416
Mun?
Being captured by Havamar means...
Is that person also a diva?
_0.9419
Diva?
Ah, if you mean singer, you're right.
I would like to cooperate with you guys to rescue her.
_0.9422
Ah, please take care of me, Garudo.
_0.9425
Brera, please introduce yourself too.
_0.9428
This is Brela Stern.
Sheryl Nome's bodyguard
He is an armored soldier of the Galaxy fleet.
_0.9431
Kisokyoukahei?
_0.9434
Also known as Cyber Grant.
In order to withstand the G forces of the new fighter jet, most of the organs other than the main organs were
It's about a pilot who has been converted into a machine.
_0.9437
Ranka Lee is my younger sister.
For Lanka and for the mission,
I have no objection to bringing this abnormal situation under control.
_0.9440
He's still the same expressionless guy.
Are you really Ranka's big brother?
_0.9443
You can do a DNA test, but
In any case, Alto, you are too uneven.
From now on, I will protect Ranka and Sheryl. I think so.
_0.9446
What are you saying!
I'm the one who will protect both of you!
_0.9449
Since you can't do it yourself, I'll protect you.
_0.9452
what! ?
_0.9455
already!
Alto-kun and Brera-san, stop fighting!
_0.9458
that's right.
What...what kind of nonsense are you fighting about?
_0.9461
centre…….
_0.9464
...Is something wrong, Chief Bowman?
_0.9467
dont 'worry.
It just reminded me of a while back.
_0.9470
And finally, the diva known as Super Dimension Cinderella.
_0.9473
I'm Ranka Lee.
Thank you very much for your help.
_0.9476
Alto's names are Sheryl and Ranka.
She was friends with famous divas.
_0.9479
Alto-kun always helps me...
_0.9482
Don't worry, Ranka.
Of course I'm going to help you.
_0.9485
Mr. Alto...
_0.9488
Ah, Grace.
Why is Havamar?
Are you trying to attract divas?
_0.9491
There are still many aspects of song energy that are not understood,
I think it's for analysis.
_0.9494
It seems that Mr. Myun was being investigated for another study.
I couldn't even grasp the contents.
_0.9497
Havamar uses the ruins Yrva Aga,
It seems like he wants to remake this world...
Mina, is that really possible?
_0.9500
If you want to control Yrva Aga,
Just like sealing
First, you will need to replenish your singing energy.
_0.9503
Then, in the control room,
By being controlled by me who can link with the ruins,
You can use Yurva Aga.
_0.9506
Whether it's sealing Yurva Aga or using it,
You need to activate six ruins.
_0.9509
And in the end, the person who holds the key is... Mina.
Is that so?
_0.9512
Yes, that's the case.
_0.9515
How did Todo and his friends give Yrva Aga to Mina?
I don't know if I can control it, but
Mina's power will definitely be needed.
_0.9518
I'm sure he'll try to get Mina someday.
_0.9521
Even if that happens, I will definitely protect Mina.
I won't give Mina to Todo and the others!
_0.9526
If we don't activate the ruins like this,
Havamar can't use Yrva Aga either.
_0.9529
However, if we leave the ruins in an unstable state as is,
You can't predict what will happen.
Let's continue working on activating the ruins.
_0.9532
Ah, I understand.
_0.9535
Well, I'd like to go back to the Yuria Archipelago right away.
_0.9538
What, on the archipelago?
_0.9541
According to the data that Grace borrowed from Havamar base,
There is information on the ruins of the archipelago,
The numbers don't match what I heard before.
_0.9544
got it. Does that mean there was information that had been kept secret since then?
Well then, let's head to the Uria Archipelago.
_0.9547
Good grief…,
It feels like I've returned to the Uria Archipelago after a long time.
_0.9550
It's not like I was born on this planet, but
It's weird because it makes me feel nostalgic.
_0.9553
Hehe, Leon is already a resident of Ouroboros.
_0.9556
It's bad that I'm calm, but
For fold wave investigation of ruins,
Could you please set up an exploration pod in this area?
_0.9559
Combined with the data I received from Grace,
I think it will be easier to discover the locations of ruins than ever before.
_0.9562
Understood.
Shall I go then?
_0.9565
Oh yeah, take Mina with you too.
_0.9568
Is it me?
I would love to help you, but why?
_0.9571
Hehe, there's something I'd like to check.
_0.9574
I don't know what you're planning, but I guess I'll go.
_0.9577
I was also involved in this work as a technical observer.
Let me help you. Thank you for your help.
_0.9580
By the way, Grace.
Garud and Brela, what kind of relationship do you three have?
_0.9583
You can think of Brera and I as having a relationship between a boss and a subordinate.
He is a manager and bodyguard for an entertainment production company.
He is also an intelligence officer and agent for the Galaxy New Joint Force.
_0.9586
I'm an employee of General Galaxy.
When he wandered onto this planet, he was picked up by Ms. Grace.
_0.9589
However, there seems to be a gap of nearly 20 years since I was there.
For now, he is under command.
_0.9592
It seems that all the people who have transcended time and space are like that,
My memories of before I came here are foggy and vague.
I feel grateful for any kind of connection.
_0.9595
got it.
I guess that was the connection.
_0.9598
You said something about the maintenance.
Are you okay, Brera?
_0.9601
Ah, no problem now.
With Gefion maintenance equipment,
Repairs have been completed to an acceptable level.
_0.9604
Originally, this artificial body was
It's for special operations. With international standard parts,
On-site maintenance is now possible.
_0.9607
With this body, I will fight to protect what I want to protect.
_0.9610
The thing I want to protect...is Ranka.
_0.9613
...Please protect your precious little sister.
_0.9616
...That's all for the nonsense.
Let's hurry to the exploration pod dispersal point.
_0.9619
Come on, Leon.
The first exploration pod.
_0.9622
Okay...set up the exploration pod.
_0.9625
There are no problems with the installation.
Confirmed system startup.
_0.9628
Well done! Lion!
_0.9631
Mina, aren't you bored with such menial work?
_0.9634
Yes, it's really fun!
Just looking at the scenery here makes me feel nostalgic for some reason.
_0.9637
The scenery of my hometown is nostalgic.
Someday I'll show you the planet I was born on.
_0.9640
Yes, I'm looking forward to it!
_0.9643
By the way, he said that he and Isamu had a mutual relationship.
What was your relationship like?
_0.9646
I'm from the same planet Eden as that guy.
Me, Isamu, and Myun were always together.
_0.9649
Many things happened that separated us, but
As a test pilot for next-generation fighter jets
It was a while ago that I met him again.
_0.9652
They continued to fight each other and it continues even now.
Next time, I intend to win completely.
_0.9655
It's nice to be childhood friends.
You seem to be having a little fun when you're talking about Isamu.
_0.9658
Hey, please stop joking.
_0.9661
But I did shoot down Isamu Dyson that time.
Although it was not a direct hit,
I don't think there's any way you can live with that?
_0.9664
Hmm. There's no way you could kill Isamu.
I'm the only one who can finish him off.
_0.9667
Above all, even though Myun is in danger,
There's no way he won't come.
That man will always keep his oath. Definitely.
_0.9670
Set up the second exploration pod.
yeah……? There's a Valkyrie approaching.
IFF belongs to the Hunter Guild...
_0.9673
Ahh! ?
After all, it's not Mina-chan!
_0.9676
picture?
Is it me? ?
_0.9679
I never expected to meet you in a place like this!
You are the modern diva who appeared on this ouroboros!
_0.9682
Huh? Diva?
What on earth is that...?
_0.9685
The hottest Mina-chan on Ouroboros right now
I'm rooting for you!
Oh, and I'm also looking forward to new videos!
_0.9688
I left without asking...
What do you mean by video?
_0.9691
What is it?
It's refreshing to me too.
_0.9694
It's the hottest in Ouroboros...
_0.9697
yeah……?
Valkyrie is approaching again.
_0.9700
As expected, it's Mina-chan!
_0.9703
damn! It's real! Really impressed!
Hey, is the photo really good?
_0.9706
eh!
Is it me? ?
_0.9709
On the Ouroboros video site
I can't believe I get to meet Mina-tan, who is a hot topic of conversation...
Really impressed!
_0.9712
Are new videos not uploaded yet?
Or are you going to put out a disc already?
_0.9715
You idiot, you must be busy preparing for the live show!
I'm looking forward to it, so see you soon!
_0.9718
What on earth is live...?
_0.9721
got it.
Somehow I can see the story.
_0.9724
Okay, drop the exploration pod. Is this the third one?
_0.9727
However, the people I just met,
What was that?
_0.9730
You can find out if you ask Aisha.
What, Aisha?
_0.9733
Well, I guess that's how it will turn out.
That's pretty sharp, isn't it, Leon?
_0.9736
Actually, the video of Mina singing,
I uploaded it to a video posting site.
_0.9741
Then it became very popular.
Now the number of views has surpassed that of Sheryl,
We also receive a lot of requests for video updates.
_0.9744
Every time Mina sang, the camera was rolling.
_0.9747
That happened without me knowing...
_0.9750
Sorry, Mina.
I should have gotten permission first.
_0.9753
I was surprised... but happy.
I can make people on this planet happy with my songs.
_0.9756
I believe that a song becomes a song when it is delivered to someone.
So that more people can hear it,
I'll do my best!
_0.9759
I'll support you too.
Good luck, Mina.
_0.9762
Well, it's kind of hard to say.
yeah? Personal line from Grace?
_0.9765
Thank you for your hard work, Leon.
I have something to talk to you about, if you don't mind.
_0.9768
Why not use a personal line?
Fine, tell me anything.
_0.9771
I think the number of people in positions is increasing rapidly.
But don't worry about that, you will always have
I want you to demonstrate leadership.
_0.9774
Ah, I see.
If that makes it easier, I don't mind.
I hadn't worried about it until now... Well, I understand.
_0.9777
I have confirmed that all exploration pods have been dropped.
Please come back to the ship.
_0.9782
Regarding Mina's video earlier,
Popular enough to compete with Sheryl.
That's a big deal.
_0.9785
This planet was completely shut down by the Ouroboros Aurora.
You can also download music via the Galaxy Network,
Now you can't do it, right?
_0.9788
Sheryl and the others' songs have various contracts and things like that...
This created the foundation for Mina's songs to become extremely popular.
_0.9791
With the appearance of a large number of protective weapons,
Maybe even the citizens are noticing something strange.
Is this a song that dispels that anxiety?
_0.9794
I don't really put that much thought into singing, but
After all, I'm glad that everyone is happy!
_0.9797
As long as Mina is happy, that's fine.
Well then, let's get back to the ship.
_0.9800
good job!
I hope we can find new ruins now...
_0.9803
The ruins seem more noisy than before.
I hope it's not a sign of something bad happening...
_0.9806
Aisha.
I have something to discuss with you, is that okay?
_0.9809
Well, of course it's fine.
_0.9812
Hmmm. That sounds interesting!
Well, I'll take care of the arrangements!
_0.9815
I got it.
Hehe, it looks like you could do well as a manager.
_0.9818
It's for Mina.
I'll do my best no matter what!
_0.9821
Mina~!
I wonder if it's okay!
_0.9824
Yes, what happened?
_0.9827
Fufufufu~.
For Mina, who is always working hard,
I've prepared a present for you!
_0.9830
present?
That's so bad,
I've always been indebted to Aisha...
_0.9833
It's okay.
Mina is working hard for this planet.
What I know best. This is your reward for your hard work.
_0.9836
Aisha....
thank you!
_0.9839
Yes Yes.
I would also be happy if you could accept it without hesitation.
Well, it's a present...
_0.9842
At Buritai City,
Mina's first live will be held!
_0.9845
Mina first live?
Does that mean you're going to see a live show?
There's a famous person with the same name as me, Mina.
_0.9848
What are you talking about?
Mina is about you.
You're going to perform at Britai City.
_0.9851
Hey, I see.
_0.9856
...Yeah yeah! ?
I-I'm live! ! ! ? ?
_0.9859
that's right!
Mina is now very popular on the internet.
I got permission from Buritai City right away!
_0.9862
But, suddenly there's a live show...
_0.9865
Mina-chan can do it.
_0.9868
Yes, be confident!
Mina-chan!
_0.9871
You said you wanted to deliver your song to a lot of people.
Isn't it a good chance?
_0.9876
What should Mina do?
You can cancel if you don't like it...?
_0.9879
I don't like it...
Thank you for preparing such a present,
I'm a really happy person...
_0.9882
...I'll sing!
_0.9885
I thought Mina would definitely do it.
Well then, I have to start preparing right away...
Leon, you understand, right?
_0.9888
Oh, leave Mina's escort to me!
No matter what happens, I'll protect you.
_0.9891
I asked for it.
Then let's head to Buritai City.
_0.9894
Then let's leave!
Hehe, I'm looking forward to Mina's live performance.
_0.9897
There's no problem with Mina.
Let's go, Mina.
_0.9902
...My heart was pounding.
_0.9905
Just do it as usual.
_0.9908
As usual...as usual...
_0.9911
Everything from setting up to staff coordination has been completed.
Let's make it the best stage.
_0.9914
Thank you, Grace!
_0.9917
If you want to thank me, please tell Sheryl.
That girl seems to like you.
I was so excited because I was asked to help.
_0.9920
Thanks to everyone's support,
You can do amazing things live.
_0.9923
Well, it's just a little bit more until the actual performance.
Mina-san, please start preparing as well.
_0.9928
The show is about to start!
Leon, I asked for security.
_0.9931
Ou!
_0.9934
Lion!
Bandits are heading towards Britai City!
_0.9937
What, bandits?
_0.9940
I don't feel like I came here to enjoy Mina's live performance.
_0.9943
I won't let you get in Mina's way!
Intercept!
_0.9946
That's amazing! !
I can't believe so many people came to listen to my songs!
_0.9949
Hey, everyone, please come to my live today.
Thank you so much Mahyu!
_0.9952
...Ugh, I bit you in an important place.
_0.9955
Mina-chan!
_0.9958
Mina-chan! Good luck!
_0.9961
Thank you everyone for all your support.
After all, it's impossible not to be nervous.
_0.9964
In today's live,
Me like this, Mina Forte
Please watch, listen and enjoy.
_0.9967
Well then, let's go! !
_0.9970
I will deliver my song to everyone!
_0.9973
Bandit reinforcements!
_0.9976
Fuck!
I was so excited...!
……oh?
_0.9979
Lion-chan, Deathyo came to assist.
Let's make Mina-chan's live a success! !
_0.9982
That's helpful, Leeron.
Okay! I won't let you interfere with Mina's live performance!
_0.9985
Newbie!
It keeps increasing!
_0.9988
See you again!
_0.9991
We didn't get tickets, but
We will help make Mina-chan's live a success!
_0.9994
Mina-tan's enemy is our enemy! !
_0.9997
A reliable ally has arrived!
Lion-chan!
_0.10000
Ou!
Before you guys see Mina live
Don't let it happen!
_0.10003
I can't confirm any enemy strength near Britai City.
Thanks for your hard work, Rion!
_0.10006
Oh my...even before my full-fledged debut,
If you have customers with such bad manners, you'll have a tough time ahead...!
_0.10009
Enemy reaction! ? I'm here again!
Be careful, Rion! Come on! !
_0.10012
Can't you listen to Mina's song quietly?
_0.10015
I came to get the diva.
If you give it to me quietly, there will be no harm.
_0.10018
It's you again! ?
Girls will hate you if you're persistent!
_0.10021
Don't be rude to your brother, Cora!
_0.10024
We will not tolerate anyone who disturbs the live performance!
I will definitely make Mina's first live a success!
_0.10027
I won't make it look bad. Give me the diva!
_0.10030
You can't just do it obediently if you're told to give it to me!
What are you thinking! ?
_0.10033
Tsk, I'm being too lenient, that's all for today.
...Let's go, Gunness!
_0.10036
Hey, brother!
_0.10039
You don't have to come anymore, you idiot! !
_0.10042
You backed down more easily than usual.
But now there will be no more people who will disturb Mina's live performance.
_0.10045
Being able to sing in front of a large number of people,
It was very, very fun!
_0.10048
It was a wonderful stage, Mina-chan.
_0.10051
I was impressed too! It was a really nice song.
I want to sing with you next time!
_0.10054
thank you!
Sheryl-san, Ranka-san!
_0.10057
I am FIRE BOMBER's
I remember my first live show.
I guess Basara was late that time too...
_0.10060
Mylene-san...
_0.10063
How was Leon?
My stage?
_0.10066
Ah, it was so good!
Mina was the one who could see the most excitement in the audience, right?
After all, we had special seats on the stage.
_0.10069
I agree!
It was a great place to see so many smiling faces!
_0.10072
Really.
I'm glad you did a live show then, Mina.
_0.10077
My heart was pounding so much that my mind went blank.
But I can see that Rion and the others are protecting me...
_0.10080
Lion...
Thank you for always protecting me.
_0.10083
Leon, I've received a message from Mr. Leeron.
_0.10086
Hey Death, Lion-chan.
_0.10089
Hey there, Leeron.
It helped me during a live show the other day.
_0.10092
Of course it's a bad thing.
_0.10095
By the way, Desuga, I have something I would like to ask you.
Is there someone named Norm over there?
_0.10098
Gnomes?
Is there a Sheryl Nome in Sarah Nome?
_0.10101
Oh~, there were two of us too!
There's one here too, Death, who wants to meet you.
_0.10104
Another gnome?
Maybe...!
_0.10107
Hey there, gnome-san, go ahead.
_0.10110
older sister!
After all, your sister came too!
_0.10113
Mao? It's Mao! ?
_0.10116
In the concert video of a girl named Mina,
I found a picture of my sister!
So I talked to the Hunter Guild, and they connected me.
_0.10119
It’s true that I received a message from Grandma Mao! ?
_0.10122
eh! ? What is grandma?
What on earth are you talking about...?
_0.10125
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
_0.10128
grandmother! ?
_0.10131
Be quiet!
_0.10136
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! !
_0.10139
Mao! ? Mao! !
_0.10142
Communication has been cut off from the city of Yue!
Kamjin is doing something wrong again, Dakara!
_0.10145
Lion!
Please help Mao! !
_0.10148
Oh, I know!
Let's hurry to Yue town!
_0.10151
With Mr. Mao,
I can't believe we will meet again like this...
_0.10154
I see, Grandma is Grace's teacher.
_0.10157
Yeah. In both the fields of space archeology and alien biology,
Mao Nome's name is a must.
Me...and Ranka-san's mother, Ranche's teacher...
_0.10160
More on that later.
Now, let's hurry to Yue town!
_0.10163
If something were to happen to Mao, Cheryl's grandmother,
I wonder what will happen to Cheryl's existence?
_0.10166
...I don't have the courage to actually check that.
Each person's timeline is independent.
That is the established theory of theoretical physics...
_0.10169
Grandma...stay safe...! !
_0.10172
I arrived in town, but...
Where are the Kamjin bastards?
_0.10175
Lion!
A Havamar aircraft is approaching us!
_0.10178
Are the guys from Havamar also targeting Mao?
I don't have time to worry about you guys!
_0.10181
To kidnap Cheryl's grandma,
As expected, there are too many!
_0.10184
Are these guys here for another purpose?
_0.10187
Damn it!
No matter how many times I defeat them, their numbers don't decrease...!
_0.10190
Don't worry!
I just want to meet my grandma...!
_0.10193
Todo's henchmen are all very hard-nosed bastards.
_0.10198
Tell Todo!
I won't let you do what you want.
You'll pay dearly for making me angry! !
_0.10201
The Havamar guys are now taken care of.
...And now comes the main point.
_0.10204
I'm in charge of Mao Gnome and the others.
If you want it back, tell us what information you know about the ruins.
Tell me!
_0.10207
you……!
_0.10210
Give me the information quickly!
Well...
_0.10213
I got it!
In return, promise Mao's safety.
_0.10216
Fine, then come to town.
I'll listen to you there.
_0.10219
There are 6 ruins to activate.
We also need six divas to match that.
If we activate everything, we should be able to stop this planet from changing.
_0.10222
Diva! ?
Are you talking about micro clones like Lin Mingmei?
_0.10225
that's right.
_0.10228
I see...that's why Todo's bastard...
Other than that! ?
_0.10231
Activating the ruins...
That's what Todo also wants.
_0.10234
That's why Todo doesn't dare to touch us.
That's what I'm thinking.
_0.10237
law. got it.
_0.10240
...Well, I got most of the information I wanted.
I'll give Mao back.
_0.10243
Where is Mao? ?
_0.10246
It's stored in a warehouse in this city.
I'll just bring it to you later.
_0.10249
And now it's a bonus.
I'll also tell you the location of Havamar base.
_0.10252
At that base, we used a guy called Myun,
I did some research.
_0.10255
Even Myun! ?
_0.10258
What kind of change in state of mind is this?
Even if you betray Havamar,
He's not the kind of guy who would pass information on to us.
_0.10261
Sorry for the misunderstanding.
I'm not really interested in Havamar.
I'm just going to destroy the guy with the biggest face here.
_0.10264
That's all for the service.
See you.
_0.10267
What is that Kamjin guy thinking...!
_0.10270
Lion!
Now it's time to rescue Mao!
_0.10273
That's right. Let's search the warehouse!
_0.10276
Mao...!
_0.10279
older sister!
_0.10282
Mao!
I'm glad you're safe....
_0.10285
grandmother!
_0.10288
Ah, uh... um, I was wondering,
Will you stop calling me grandma?
_0.10291
I-I'm sorry...
I don't know how to explain it, but
I'm actually your grandson...um...
_0.10294
Grandchild? Ah, I see.
This is the future world, so even if my grandchild is here...
Hey, hey, what will happen to me in the future? ?
_0.10297
Because you, my grandchild, are so beautiful,
I'm sure she married a very handsome man!
Maybe Shin! ? Or maybe someone else! ?
_0.10300
Shin...!
Hey, Mao!
_0.10303
I mean, she's not super beautiful!
It's the first time I've been this excited!
_0.10306
I-I'm sorry....
I haven't seen my grandma for a long time,
I don't know about that kind of private life...
_0.10309
Is that so. That can't be helped.
Even if I ask too much about the future,
It gets boring after that...
_0.10312
That's right, Shin! ?
Mao, weren't you with Shin?
_0.10315
Yeah. I haven't met Shin either...
Hey, are you also looking for these people and Shin?
_0.10318
Shin is
He was the one who had a love triangle with the grandmothers, right?
_0.10321
Cheers, Cheryl! How dare you say that!
I can’t believe I, the shrine maiden of Mayan, have such a relationship with Shin…!
Why would you do such a thing in the first place?
_0.10324
In the future world, it's turned into a movie.
Pilot Shin Kudo landed on Mayan Island,
A movie about two girls, Sarah and Mao, who fall in love.
_0.10327
Yeah! ? Movies are about those moving pictures!
Wow wow!
Hey, hey, I was cute in the movie! ?
_0.10330
Well, actually, I played the role...
_0.10333
Wow, so cute!
Then, in the future, I will have this cute image.
I feel like I've gained a little something!
_0.10336
Oh, that’s it…!
Mao is cuter!
_0.10339
Outside civilizations always reflect our history,
I'll change it for the better...!
It's love...!
_0.10342
Well, if your sister is like that,
I can help you though.
_0.10345
Ma, Mao! ?
_0.10348
Shin Kudo? I learned this in a modern military history class.
One of the earliest Valkyrie pilots to fly the VF-0.
He must have been one of the legendary Skull Platoon.
_0.10351
If Alto is Sheryl's knight
It wouldn't be strange if Shin was also blown away by Ouroboros.
_0.10354
older sister!
I want to find Shin!
I'm sure Shin is looking for us too!
_0.10357
This journey aims to quell the planet's spirits and return time to its proper state.
It's something more noble.
Do you understand that this is not a game, Mao?
_0.10360
I understand, sister.
But I never thought it would be like a dream to be able to leave the island like this!
_0.10363
Mao!
_0.10366
Grandma is quite a free-spirited person...
_0.10369
It seems like your sister is taking care of you too.
Can I take care of you too?
_0.10372
Of course.
_0.10375
thank you.
Well then, good luck from now on, everyone!
_0.10378
Information from Kamjin,
I found out the base where Myun is being held.
It was supposed to be Havamar base, which controlled the archipelago.
_0.10381
...Head to that base.
_0.10384
Wait a minute!
It would be too reckless to do anything without any surrounding information.
_0.10387
Now I want to get closer to Myun as soon as possible.
Myun won't be saved just by waiting.
_0.10390
I moved the exploration pod and searched the base, but...
I can't see any activity.
_0.10395
As expected, it would take time to investigate that much.
_0.10398
Whether it's a trap or not, I'm just helping Myun.
_0.10401
If this continues, Garud will go to the base alone.
It can't be helped, just like Gard said.
Let's go to the base first! !
_0.10404
Lion.
I'm sorry that I forced the conversation.
_0.10407
yeah?
What do you mean?
Let's hurry instead! Garde!
_0.10410
……roger that. appreciate.
_0.10413
We'll soon be at the base Kamjin mentioned.
I hope this doesn't get in the way.
_0.10416
If anything gets in your way, just crush it.
_0.10419
That's hot, Garde.
Let's go calmly.
_0.10422
what……! ?
Is that old style coming here? ?
Which hunter is this...?
_0.10425
That was the plane that hit Mayan! ?
_0.10428
Leon, please be careful!
It's locked on!
_0.10431
I know!
Siegfried 1, engage!
_0.10434
These guys...they're fast!
_0.10437
You're late!
D.D. ! _ _ _ The variable fighter pilots of this era are amateurs!
It's okay to finish him off!
_0.10440
ah!
The dead guy is an idiot!
_0.10443
Dance! Dance! Let's dance! !
_0.10446
What a movement in such an old style! ?
_0.10449
Hmm, are you serious about that, Hiyoko! !
_0.10452
Don't treat me like a kid!
_0.10455
Schwalbe 1 found the fugitive Kamzin.
Stop playing and come back quickly!
_0.10458
Hmm, considering they're called special forces, their hunting skills are good.
Let's pull you up, Nora! The fun will come later!
_0.10461
Tsk...almost there,
I could have killed them all!
_0.10464
Let's just take a look at the condition of the aircraft today!
_0.10467
It looks like he has retreated.
I can't believe there are people who can do that much with such an old style...
_0.10470
For now, my top priority is to help Myun.
Let's head to the base.
_0.10473
After all, it doesn't look like the base is operational.
_0.10476
That's convenient. Search everything in the base.
_0.10479
Myun! Isn’t it there? Myun!
_0.10482
I accessed the terminal at the base, but
I don't know if the information has been deleted.
_0.10485
I guess I'll just have to search steadily.
_0.10488
Where is Myun!
_0.10491
Don't you have any clues?
_0.10494
Calm down a little, Garudo.
_0.10497
I'm calm!
_0.10500
Is it a dead end...?
_0.10503
I'll look for another one.
_0.10506
Hmm...is it different here too?
_0.10509
There's only one person left.
Maybe this base is already...
_0.10512
Myun….
_0.10515
Apparently it wasn't a trap,
It looks like this base is no longer in use.
_0.10518
Considering the situation, it looks like they're in the process of abandoning the facility.
If that's the case, Myun-san has already been transferred.
_0.10521
Does that mean they have already evacuated from this base?
_0.10524
That's right...
_0.10527
Garud and Myun have already been transferred to another base.
Let's get back to the ship.
_0.10530
Ahh…….
_0.10533
It seems that Myun-san had already been transferred to another base.
Is it possible that Kamjin was lying?
_0.10536
It didn't look like he was lying though.
_0.10539
It was used before Kamjin betrayed him...
_0.10542
It was good just to be able to track down the information that Myun was there.
_0.10545
It is not found in the Sierra Desert or the Uriah Archipelago.
If so, does that mean it's a different area?
_0.10548
That's right.
Investigations using exploration pods have not yielded any good information,
That seems highly likely.
_0.10551
After all, Havamar has been around for a long time.
The Madis Glacier, which was designated as a special management zone, is suspicious.
_0.10554
For that purpose, we need to see the Ouroboros Aurora around the Madis Glacier.
I need to release it.
_0.10557
One of the ruins in the desert is suspicious,
Ever since I was able to go to the Sierra Desert,
The startup method seems complicated, so I haven't been able to analyze it yet.
_0.10560
If there's anything I can do, please tell me.
_0.10563
Yes, that helps, Grace.
Well, I have to go back to the desert and analyze the ruins!
_0.10566
Myun, please wait...
_0.10569
Ah~! Already!
What am I missing? !
Sigh...I can't think straight...
_0.10572
Aisha, your face is scary...
_0.10575
Mina-chan...
There are good things and bad things to say in this world.
_0.10578
It hurts, Aisha!
Please don't pull your cheeks! !
_0.10581
Aisha, please forgive me.
_0.10584
The fact that you look difficult means that
Are you still unable to analyze the startup method?
_0.10587
Eh...
We can't go to Madis Glacier like this.
_0.10590
Lion...
I'm sorry, but could you please go on a research flight over the Sierra Desert?
_0.10593
It doesn't seem like he's holding back.
That's how cheap it is.
_0.10596
Thank you, Rion...
_0.10599
Near the ouroboros aurora control ruins in the desert,
Please do a fold wave survey.
Please fly near the ruins and send me the results of your investigation.
_0.10602
Understood, don't push yourself too hard.
_0.10605
Eh...
_0.10608
I sent you the location of the ruins.
So, like I said, please do some research.
_0.10611
Leave it to me.
_0.10614
What do you think, Leon?
_0.10617
We have only just started the investigation.
I don't have any particular reaction, but...
_0.10620
yes…….
If you find something, even if it's a small thing, it's fine.
Please contact me.
_0.10623
Ou. Got it!
_0.10626
Leon, what do you think?
_0.10629
That's right...there's nothing for now.
_0.10632
Even things that have nothing to do with the ruins,
This may be important, so don't overlook it.
_0.10635
Ou. Understood…….
_0.10638
Aisha is really excited...
_0.10641
communication? Who is it from?
_0.10644
Leon...come to Morricone Hill.
_0.10649
I think I need to talk to you once.
Look, I'll be waiting for you at Morricone Hill.
_0.10652
He just said what he wanted to say and hung up.
Do not be silly! Hold on, Rod!
There are so many things I want to say here!
_0.10655
Have you come? Lion...
_0.10658
I never expected you to call me.
_0.10661
...This is the final confirmation.
You...don't you intend to walk the same path as me?
_0.10664
...Don't give up on that, Rod.
Think about it. If a world was created in which Mia would never die,
It is a world built on the sacrifices of the present world.
_0.10667
There's no way Mia would want that.
Still, do you think it's right? ?
You can understand that much! ?
_0.10670
I'm not wrong...!
_0.10673
As long as Mia comes back...that's all I need!
If he comes back,
I wish I could die instead! !
_0.10676
You idiot! !
That's not what Mia wants! !
_0.10679
As long as Mia is alive, that's enough for me!
you understand that !?
_0.10682
rod….
That is a dream that must not come true...!
_0.10687
Rion...I will follow the path I believe in.
I don't care about this world anymore...
_0.10690
I'll go... until the end.
_0.10693
Hey, wait! rod!
Don't go! still…! !
_0.10696
You idiot...!
_0.10699
It seems like Leon was stopping by Morricone Hill.
what's wrong with you?
_0.10702
No, it's nothing...
_0.10705
yes….
I don't have a problem with that, but
May I ask you to return to investigating the ruins immediately?
_0.10708
I should be able to analyze it in a little while...
If only I knew that...!
_0.10711
...Aisha, are you okay?
_0.10714
picture?
_0.10717
I know you're doing your best for everyone.
But if you get so excited, you won't come up with any good ideas, right?
_0.10720
But...!
_0.10723
That's right.
Aisha is trying a little too hard.
_0.10726
Even Mina...
_0.10729
………………Sigh.
_0.10732
...Yeah, that's right.
I think I was a little too anxious...
_0.10735
Hey, why don't we take a break around here?
_0.10738
A break?
_0.10741
ah.
If you feel refreshed, your head will also be clear!
Let's invite Sheryl and the others and have fun at the oasis! !
_0.10744
It's decided!
Well then, Aisha, please call out to everyone.
_0.10748
eh!
Hey, hey, Rion!
_0.10751
...Thank you, Rion.
It felt like I was paying attention to her, which was bad.
_0.10754
yeah?
Ah...I just wanted to play.
_0.10757
Hehe...
_0.10760
Hey, does Rion have a girlfriend?
_0.10763
yeah?
There's no way he's there.
_0.10766
yes….
That was good....
_0.10769
Oh, hey... Are you glad?
What do you mean... Aisha?
_0.10772
...Because if I had a lover...
_0.10775
...What if you were there?
_0.10778
This is the situation where we can't even get in touch.
It makes me really worried.
_0.10781
As expected, as my boss,
It will be bad if you don't take care of it!
It's tough at times like this for managers.
_0.10784
Ah, ah, I see.
In that sense...
_0.10787
Leon! Can I have a moment?
_0.10790
Whoa, what?
I'll go now, so please wait.
See you then, Aisha.
_0.10793
Yeah.
_0.10796
...Sigh.
I can't believe I asked such a thing directly...
_0.10799
Just...just think about it.
fool…….
_0.10802
Help me clean up,
Thank you, Leon.
_0.10805
Don't worry about it.
More importantly, Mina, did you have fun today?
_0.10808
Yes!
it was very fun!
_0.10811
However, it was my first time wearing a swimsuit with such a design.
I was very embarrassed, but...
_0.10814
Haha, you look good on me, Mina.
_0.10817
Oh, that's it...
Cheryl is better...
No, Aisha would say something like this...it's amazing!
_0.10820
Um, uh...um...
I'll do my best!
I wish I could be like Aisha!
_0.10823
I don't really understand what you're talking about...
Well, do your best, Mina.
_0.10828
Then I'll go to sleep now.
good night.
_0.10831
Good night, Leon.
_0.10834
Hmm, by the time I put on my swimsuit next time.
I have to aim for a style that rivals Aisha's...!
_0.10837
Even so...when Rion saw me in a swimsuit,
Apart from being embarrassed, I was excited because
What the hell was that?
_0.10840
The analysis of the ruins has been completed! ?
_0.10843
Yes, I was having a difficult time. Aisha tracked it down.
But it seems like I tried a little too hard.
I'm currently resting in the infirmary.
_0.10846
I see... I'm coming!
_0.10849
Lion.
_0.10854
We all went to the oasis, right?
Aisha, we talked happily many times while analyzing the ruins.
I wonder if it was a source of emotional support?
_0.10857
Really…….
_0.10860
a……. Lion?
_0.10863
ah.
_0.10866
...Looks like I was sound asleep.
_0.10869
Also, it seems like you worked harder than usual.
_0.10872
I'm sorry for worrying you...
_0.10875
Including that, Aisha, right?
_0.10878
I see, that's right.
_0.10881
Let's go to the oasis again.
_0.10884
……Yeah.
_0.10887
Thanks to Aisha, I found out how to activate it.
I have to repay your hard work.
_0.10890
Nice to meet you, Leon.
_0.10893
This is the Ouroboros Aurora Control Ruins.
_0.10896
Well then, I guess I'll go.
_0.10899
To go to Madis Glacier,
Let's do our best, Rion!
_0.10902
Right, let's hurry to the control room.
_0.10905
This is the control room.
_0.10908
You should now be able to activate the ruins system...
Mina, I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.10911
yes!
I won't let Aisha's hard work go to waste!
_0.10914
If my information processing and analysis are correct,
It should start now, but...
_0.10917
How about success?
_0.10920
...Yeah, okay, it looks like it went well.
Now, let's hurry back to the ship and hurry to Madis Glacier!
_0.10923
Does the guardian weapon become stronger with each battle?
Perhaps it was made in imitation of Vajra,
I wonder if it's a biological weapon?
_0.10926
Even so, no matter how many come out, this one is better.
We can't win!
_0.10929
It's out!
_0.10932
Leon, be careful!
_0.10935
Today, I was told not to destroy the guard weapon for investigation.
Won't you say it?
_0.10938
fool!
You are better than that...!
_0.10941
Nah, it's nothing!
Go ahead and defeat him!
_0.10946
Chiiiiiii!
As expected, it's big and cute! !
_0.10949
Don't overdo it, Rion.
_0.10952
I recognize your ability, but
If you have someone to protect, restrain your heart.
_0.10955
Don't worry Aisha and Mina!
_0.10958
As long as you defeat this guy, you can go to Madis Glacier!
I can't take forever! !
_0.10961
Concentrate your attacks on the big one.
You can't move forward unless you destroy that thing.
_0.10964
Confirmed shooting down of enemy aircraft.
Phew... Looks like I managed to defeat it.
_0.10967
Now you can move to Madis Glacier.
Return to Gefion.
_0.10970
Now you can go to Madis Glacier.
_0.10973
That's right.
In just a little while, we can stop this strange phenomenon on this planet...!
_0.10976
Lion!
There's an aircraft approaching us.
It's VF-1 though...
_0.10979
VF-1?
Another old aircraft...
_0.10982
Ah, there's a communication from the other side.
_0.10985
I can't believe it...!
That Teru Ichijo is right in front of me...!
_0.10988
Um...every time I say my name, I get that kind of reaction.
I'm not that big of a deal.
I wish the nerds would stop exaggerating their reactions.
_0.10991
Ah, ah... I'm sorry.
I've watched a lot of dramas and movies where you are the main character...
_0.10994
It seems so.
I've seen a few of them, so I have a general idea of the situation.
_0.10997
There were a lot of things that were dramatized.
_0.11000
Major Misa Hayase is also right in front of me...!
Well, I'm sorry for having the same reaction over and over again...
_0.11003
Looks like I'll become quite a celebrity in the future.
Let me move on.
_0.11006
Actually here,
I came to ask you to lend me your strength.
_0.11009
I want you to help me save Minmei.
_0.11012
Minmei...?
That legendary songstress Lin Minmei! ?
_0.11015
Maybe that Lin Mingmei.
She was kidnapped by a group of guys called Havamar.
I tried it, but it's just me.
_0.11018
I heard rumors from the guild that nerds were fighting with them,
I was wondering if you could lend me your strength.
_0.11021
got it. Lieutenant Ichijo, you told me that.
There's probably no pilot in this galaxy who would say no.
_0.11024
That will help.
Minmei should be at Madis Glacier.
I'm sorry, but please help me.
_0.11027
Ah, thank you very much.
_0.11030
There's a high possibility that Myun is also captured there.
Rion, Aisha, hurry to Madis Glacier!
_0.11033
Well then, let's go rescue the songstresses.
Let's head to Madis Glacier!
_0.11036
Looks like I read it correctly after all.
As soon as we arrived at Madis Glacier,
I discovered a ruin that is emitting fold waves.
_0.11039
Then I'll start the ruins next.
_0.11042
Thank you very much Ranka! !
_0.11045
From Havamar the moment you reach the glacier
I thought I would receive a warm welcome, but...
_0.11048
As Aisha thinks, it seems like it's convenient.
_0.11051
Very death! Very death!
Havamar on Dawkins Plain
Death has destroyed the new joint military base!
_0.11054
What did you say! ?
Are you sure?
_0.11057
Definite information.
Information from surviving soldiers and information from surrounding residents.
Desne, I don't know what Todo-kun is going to do...
_0.11060
Please take care of yourself too, Lion-chan.
_0.11063
Ah, I see.
I'm sorry you took the trouble to contact me.
_0.11066
Rod...The world you want is...
Is it possible to achieve this...?
_0.11069
Havamar too,
Does that mean I can't pretend to be anymore?
_0.11072
Come on.
But I don't think there's any need to go out of your way to increase the number of enemies.
I can't read Todo's true intentions.
_0.11075
That's right.
As for our actions, the fact that they were on Todo's palm makes me angry,
Now let's head to activate the ruins as planned.
_0.11078
That's right.
Then, when you're ready, we'll set out.
_0.11081
I will protect Ranka...
_0.11084
As expected, it's cold...
_0.11087
Now that I'm on my way,
This "Madis Glacier" is the home of Havamar,
There is the ruins of Yrva Aga.
_0.11090
Don't say such careless things,
Keep your spirits up!
_0.11093
Well, that's right.
There are only three more ruins to activate, so let's get excited!
_0.11096
Well then, let's head to the ruins.
_0.11099
yeah?
Communication from Leeron?
_0.11102
Sorry, I forgot to contact you earlier.
Descara is now able to go to the glacier thanks to Lion-chan and his friends.
The Hunter Guild will soon be moving into Madis Glacier!
_0.11105
I'm sure I'll have more interactions with Havamar from now on.
It would be helpful if hunters could support us.
_0.11108
From death that is sure to come!
Wait for me, Kudasides!
_0.11111
Me and Cheryl,
To replenish the ruins with song energy,
You were called to this planet, right?
_0.11114
yes.
We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you all.
sorry.
_0.11117
No.
Don't worry, Mina-chan.
It was certainly difficult because I got caught, but...
_0.11120
I was able to meet everyone like this,
I think it was really good.
_0.11123
thank you.
I was also glad to meet Ranka-san.
_0.11126
We'll arrive at the ruins soon.
Are you ready?
_0.11129
it's okay!
Let's do our best, Mina-chan!
_0.11132
Yes!
Mr. Ranka!
_0.11135
Here...
I was a little nervous.
_0.11138
I can feel Ranka's excitement.
It looks like you're starting to get along with Ranka-san.
_0.11141
picture? Is that so?
It's a little embarrassing.
But I might also feel Mina's excitement.
_0.11144
Can I also agree with Ranka?
_0.11147
Brera….
How much I love Ranka...
_0.11150
It seems that what is hindering our progress is
It seems like it's only the guardian weapon of the ruins.
_0.11153
That's surprising considering it's so close to Havamar's headquarters.
_0.11156
It's nice to have fewer enemies.
There will be less danger in Ranka.
_0.11159
I understand.
Ranka is always my top priority...
_0.11162
…let's go.
_0.11165
The resistance of the guardian weapon is getting even stronger!
_0.11168
As the ruins are refilled with song energy,
It seems that the strength of the guardian weapon is increasing even more.
_0.11171
It looks like it's going to be tough when it comes to the fifth and sixth ruins.
I can't let my guard down.
_0.11174
Eliminate all those who try to harm Ranka.
_0.11177
Mr. Brera, please don't be reckless.
_0.11180
I wonder if the deepest part of the ruins is still far away?
_0.11183
If you're tired, why don't you take a little rest, Ranka?
_0.11186
It's okay, Brera.
Activate the ruins quickly,
I have to help Mina-chan!
_0.11189
You should sing here!
_0.11192
yes. I will link to the ruins from now on.
Please think of Ranka-san's loved ones as you sing...
_0.11195
My important person....
Yeah, I understand! Well then, let's sing!
_0.11198
(Alto-kun....)
_0.11201
Ranka's song comes to me...
_0.11204
(Ranka-san's feelings towards Aruto-san...
I like this"? )
_0.11207
(I know this feeling...)
_0.11214
Successful?
I was really nervous.
_0.11217
Yes, yes.
Ranka-san's feelings came into my mind...
_0.11220
What's wrong, Mina-chan? ?
Is your face red?
_0.11223
Mina?
Isn't it also a fever?
_0.11226
...Eh, uh...
I have a strong affinity with Ranka-san,
It seems like I overdid it a little bit...
_0.11229
It's impossible...is it okay? ?
_0.11232
Yes, yes.
it's okay…….
_0.11235
Mina, you always push yourself too hard.
Please stop being so reckless like you did with the database ruins.
No matter how many hearts you have, it's never enough.
_0.11238
I wish you could rely on me more.
I'll do what I can to accept it.
What?
_0.11241
I'm sorry...Rion.
thank you for worrying about me….
_0.11244
(Lanka's song. Feelings of thinking about someone.
I finally understood... I'm talking about Rion... )
_0.11247
There are two left. I'll be able to activate all the ruins in a little while.
Let's go back to the ship.
_0.11250
...What is Havamar's movement?
_0.11253
I regularly receive information from Leeron,
There's nothing particularly remarkable.
Well, I guess there's a lot going on behind the scenes.
_0.11256
Mobilize all your forces,
It's not like they're going to attack us...
_0.11259
Havamar is
I guess they're waiting for us to activate the ruins.
Mina is the only one who can activate the ruins.
_0.11262
You need to analyze the information carefully.
_0.11265
That's right...
YF-30 testing is progressing smoothly.
We have to be careful when dealing with Havamar.
_0.11268
There are only two ruins left to activate.
I'm also curious about Havamar's movements,
First of all, we need to do something about the ruins.
_0.11271
Leon, come to the bridge now!
Kamjin kidnapped Minmei!
_0.11274
What did you say! ?
_0.11277
I'm in charge of Minmei.
If you want it back, come to Havamar base!
Well then.
_0.11280
What is he doing this time? ?
_0.11283
Thanks to that, I found out Minmei's whereabouts.
I'm sorry, but please help me rescue Minmei.
_0.11286
Leave it to me.
Will the legendary singer be the next after the legendary pilot?
I never thought the day would come when I would be able to admire Lin Mingmei with my own eyes...
_0.11289
...I'm curious about Kamjin's movements.
Why did you kidnap Minmei?
Did you tell us?
_0.11292
There's no point in worrying about that guy!
I'm just doing whatever I want anyway.
_0.11295
Really, no matter where he is, he doesn't waver in what he does.
I respect that in a way.
_0.11298
You can ask the person directly about the purpose of Kamjin.
Now, let's go with the Minmei rescue mission.
_0.11301
I'm really glad to have met you in this era.
I'm sorry that I keep taking care of you.
_0.11304
Don't worry about it.
Let's focus on helping Minmei for now.
_0.11307
Hey, what's going to happen?
Havamar is attacking your base!
_0.11310
Aren't they trying to take back the base that Khamjin occupied?
_0.11313
Kamjin's gang retreated into the base.
From now on, we will form an assault force and capture the base...!
_0.11316
No, wait!
Check out Gefion's machines! !
Let's start the interception!
_0.11319
And it seems like the enemy is intent on destroying us too.
I'll intercept you! Siegfried 1!
_0.11322
Havamar is an easy opponent to fight once you get used to it.
This time there are many.
_0.11325
No matter how many there are, you just have to knock them all down.
That's it.
_0.11328
You must remain calm in the face of such a large number of enemies.
It's really reassuring!
_0.11331
It seems like everything is sorted out.
I have so many talented friends and I can rely on Kochitora!
_0.11334
It's an honor for me to fight alongside you, Lieutenant.
Let's go. Kamjin is waiting for you at the base.
_0.11337
However, it is very different from the image.
I thought he was more of a scary demon-like guy.
_0.11340
I? Jordan!
Just like otaku, you're just a normal young person, Kochitora!
It's not something that will go down in history by accident. Absolutely.
_0.11343
Is that so?
Well, this one is also easy to do and helpful.
Now, let's go help Minmei!
_0.11346
Ahh.
Please wait, Minmei!
_0.11349
Even so,
Even though they fought against the Zentraedi for the survival of humanity,
Because humans are still at war with each other...
_0.11352
...It's not good at all.
_0.11355
Still, the battle of the lieutenants was not in vain.
Because you protected us, we are where we are today.
_0.11358
I'm really happy to hear that.
I guess my hard work was worth it too.
_0.11361
Intruder found!
That emblem is Skull Platoon! ?
_0.11364
Hey, you've become famous.
_0.11367
Minmei's life is at stake.
I'm sorry, but I'll have you move away!
_0.11370
Did Khamjin have this many subordinates?
_0.11373
It's a big force.
Havamar should also have a hard time.
_0.11376
The Kamjin guy....
_0.11379
Than being captured by Havamar.
I do feel safer with Kamjin though.
_0.11382
Bitten by Kamjin,
Todo may also have his head in his hands.
_0.11385
Gefion from Skull 1.
I can't find Minmei. Continue exploring.
_0.11388
Let's look for it without haste.
Both the Havamar soldiers and Kamzin's men,
Looks like there's still a lot left.
_0.11391
Is this the last time?
Hey, where's Minmei?
_0.11394
Mi, if it was Minmei-chan, the general took her out...
_0.11397
It's outside the base!
Lion, let's chase!
_0.11400
Come on!
I'll get Minmei back!
_0.11403
It's like the appearance of the Knight of Culture.
Isn't there a familiar face there?
_0.11406
Why are you Minmei?
You betrayed Havamar! ?
_0.11409
betrayed?
As I said before, I don't remember following Todo from Hanat.
_0.11412
If you look at the Zentraedi, you think they're idiots who can't think straight.
It hasn't changed even after 50 cycles.
Micron is a bunch of idiots.
_0.11415
So, why did you come to this place?
What are you going to do by taking Minmei away from Havamar? ?
_0.11418
I have no intention of doing anything.
Yes, it's the same as Todo. Awakening the ruins with the power of culture,
I'll do something nice.
_0.11421
The calligraphy is good. Come on over.
If you want Minmei-chan back, do everything in your power!
Let's act like men, shall we?
_0.11424
Don't make nerds represent all the men in the universe!
Minmei will be returned!
_0.11427
That's quite a feat!
It's time to get serious!
_0.11430
Damn it!
I don't have time to deal with these guys...!
_0.11433
I found out where Minmei is!
_0.11436
Shining!
I'll be Kamjin's opponent!
You are Minmei!
_0.11439
Sorry, Leon!
Alright! Please wait, Minmei! !
_0.11442
What's the matter with disappearing in the middle of a battle?
Isn't that a violation of manners?
_0.11445
I'll deal with you instead!
Come on!
_0.11448
Heh!
Then feel free to go!
_0.11451
From Skull 1 to Siegfried 1.
I rescued Minmei.
I repeat, Minmei was rescued!
_0.11454
Alright!
Now all that's left is Kamjin and the others...!
_0.11457
Well, something like this...
Bastards, retreat! !
_0.11460
picture……?
Are you going to let go of Minmei-chan? ?
_0.11463
I just want Todo to blow a bubble.
That's enough.
_0.11466
Hey, that's really the reason,
Have you been moving around all this time? ?
_0.11469
Hey, it was quite fun playing with you guys.
However, I have no interest in ruins or the reconstruction of the world!
You guys are playing with Todo without permission.
_0.11472
eh!
Big brother! ? So what are we going to do now?
_0.11475
You idiot!
You can decide that at that time!
Bye bye. I hope we never meet again.
_0.11478
Ah, brother! !
Please wait! ! !
_0.11481
The Kamjin guy is quite free-spirited.
_0.11484
I saved Minmei too, so let's get back to the ship.
_0.11489
This is the real Minmei!
Wow, the aura is completely different!
_0.11492
can't believe it…….
The legendary songstress is right in front of me...
_0.11495
Everyone is honored to meet you.
My father was inspired by your song and accepted Earth's culture.
It was Zentraedi.
_0.11498
This is Lin Mingmei...
It seems like a wall worth crossing over...!
_0.11501
So many people...?
_0.11504
Apparently, we are famous people in this day and age.
_0.11507
No. The military people who captured me,
That's how I felt, so I was surprised...
_0.11510
Are you okay?
Are you not hurt, Minmei-san?
_0.11513
thank you. All right.
_0.11516
It was really good...
_0.11519
Minmei. I was getting you with these guys
In order to stop what Havamar is trying to do,
I would like to cooperate.
_0.11522
I want Minmei to help me too, is that okay?
_0.11525
I will support whatever Akira does!
Nice to meet you everyone!
_0.11528
Thank you very much.
Well, when I think of her as a legendary songstress,
I'm really nervous.
_0.11531
Hehe.
Everyone, please feel free to call me Minmei.
_0.11534
I rescued Minmei.
All that's left to do is activate the ruins.
Aisha, how's the ruins exploration going?
_0.11537
I confirmed the remaining two ruins.
Both are near Havamar base.
_0.11540
All six ruins have now been found.
Things are going so well that I feel bad...
_0.11543
Is it okay if I sing there?
_0.11546
Ahh.
Minmei's songs have that power.
_0.11549
Two ruins were found,
Which ruins would be fine, Mina?
_0.11552
home.
In fact, it has already been decided who will sing at which ruins.
_0.11555
Was something like that already decided?
So I guess I've been lucky so far.
_0.11558
Well...
Minmei-san is in this ruin!
_0.11561
I got it.
Akira, I'll try it.
_0.11564
Minmei is fine.
_0.11567
I'll bring out the navigation, so I don't think I'll make a mistake.
Just head towards the ruins you're aiming for.
_0.11570
Understood.
This is the activation of the fifth ruin. Let's get fired up and go.
Teru, Minmei, Mina.
_0.11573
Minmei, let's go!
Are you ready?
_0.11576
Well, anytime is fine.
Shining.
_0.11579
Well then, let's go!
_0.11582
How's Havamar doing?
_0.11585
At the same time as this sortie,
I caught a Havamar aircraft on my radar.
I'm not heading towards the ruins at the moment, but be careful!
_0.11588
We have arrived at our destination ruins.
Leave it to me, Mina, Minmei!
_0.11591
I will do my best!
_0.11594
Well, leave it to me.
_0.11597
Minmei.
Don't worry, Leon and I will protect you.
_0.11600
“It has already been decided who will sing at which ruins.”
As you said, could you please tell me more details?
_0.11603
Each ruin has a singing voice that is easy to respond to.
_0.11606
It's not just the quantity of energy that matters, but the quality as well.
_0.11609
yes.
So it's the same song.
In other words, the same person cannot activate multiple ruins.
_0.11612
I see.
_0.11615
Looks like there's no Havamar.
_0.11618
I think Havamar is intentionally leaving us alone.
_0.11621
To start or stop Yurva Aga,
They also understand that we need singing energy.
_0.11624
Even if it's what the other person thinks,
I can't afford not to activate the ruins.
Let's go inside.
_0.11627
The guardian weapons guys have powered up again.
_0.11630
It means that you can't easily get to the place where you want to start it.
Minmei, I'll definitely protect you, so don't worry.
_0.11633
I understand, Akira.
_0.11636
Damn, it's a protective weapon again.
There's no end to it.
_0.11639
If we don't activate the ruins,
These guys are all over Ouroboros
It might not be strange if it gets full.
_0.11642
Almost there!
Minmei-san!
_0.11645
Good.
I thought I was going to be fighting this robot forever.
_0.11648
Should I sing here, Mina-chan?
_0.11651
yes. I will link to the ruins from now on.
Please sing while thinking of Minmei's loved ones...
_0.11654
important person….
_0.11657
Well then, let's sing.
_0.11660
(……………………Shiru.)
_0.11663
Minmei's song comes to me...
_0.11666
The activation of the ruins has been confirmed.
Minmei's feelings...
He was so kind, yet so strong, I was moved.
_0.11669
Huh.
_0.11672
All this energy in a blink of an eye
I can't believe we're coming together... It's really amazing!
Minmei-san!
_0.11675
This is the song that ended the war between humanity and the Zentraedi...
It's amazing...I can't stop shaking my heart.
_0.11678
It's amazing after all.
Minmei's song is...
_0.11681
Confirmed that the fold wave emitted by the ruins has changed.
This is the fifth one. There's one more thing.
_0.11684
Also, there is a person named Myun.
If I can get it back from Havamar...!
_0.11687
I'm sure Evil,
You can seal Yurva Aga!
_0.11690
That's right.
Now, let's get back to the ship.
_0.11693
Thanks to everyone, there is only one remaining sealed ruin left to activate.
Once that's done, all that's left to do is seal away Yurva Aga...
_0.11696
The question is, where is Mr. Myun?
Maybe Todo will contact me...
_0.11699
Until I activate the ruins, my goal is the same as Todo's.
_0.11702
By the way, what should I do after starting the 6th one?
_0.11705
...In case the ruins song energy is insufficient again someday,
Return to the same state as before.
_0.11708
Is it the same state?
Mina, maybe...!
_0.11711
I fell asleep again,
I will seal Yurva Aga!
_0.11714
Wait! Mina!
I never heard of that! !
_0.11717
sorry…….
When accessing the database ruins,
I had regained my memory, but...I couldn't say it...
_0.11720
But I can't help it.
Because this is my destiny...
_0.11723
No...it's the meaning of existence...!
_0.11726
Mina!
Hey, are you really okay with that?
_0.11729
that's right!
I don't want it to end up sacrificing you.
I will never admit it!
_0.11732
Me too!
I can't believe I have to say goodbye to Leon and the others.
I'm sure you don't like it! !
_0.11735
but!
If this continues... there will be ruins...!
_0.11740
But...huh?
…If you say so.
Mina, would you mind?
_0.11743
...What is it, Aisha?
_0.11746
when you wake up
The ruins collapsed and the capsule was destroyed, right?
Without that, can it be sealed in the same way?
_0.11749
eh! ?
_0.11752
Yes, that's right.
At that time, it was badly broken.
_0.11757
Oh, that's right! !
_0.11760
What should I do...what should I do...! !
_0.11763
With this, I was able to avoid Mina falling asleep, but...
It will be bad if we don't do something about it.
Is there no other way?
_0.11766
Oh, there's another way....
Erm, erm......Ah!
_0.11769
There is!
_0.11772
Yes!
If you feed song energy directly to Fold Evil,
You can sleep forever.
_0.11775
Not just a temporary seal, but forever?
If there is such a method,
Why wasn't this done in the ancient Ouroboros era?
_0.11778
In the time I was born,
I just couldn't gather that much energy to sing.
_0.11781
That's how much singing energy is required...
_0.11784
that's,
That means we divas just have to do our best, right?
_0.11787
That may be true, but...
But if I don't have enough singing energy
I can't predict what will happen...
_0.11790
There's me, Sheryl Nome.
There's nothing you can't do! !
_0.11793
That's right, Sheryl.
I will also help Mina-chan!
_0.11796
but! but!
Putting everyone in danger...! !
_0.11799
I'll do my best too.
Don't worry, Mina.
_0.11802
Let's sing as long as our voices last...
_0.11805
If you all sing together, you'll be able to put out more energy than usual!
_0.11808
There's no point in saying anything, Mina.
I've already decided what to do.
_0.11811
The songs will be sung by some of the greatest divas in history.
Easy win, easy win!
_0.11814
Everyone, it's me...!
_0.11817
I'll definitely make it a success.
So please don't cry like that, Mina.
_0.11820
You're cuter when you smile.
_0.11823
Pfft, ahahahahaha.
Rion is saying some nasty things...
_0.11826
I finally laughed.
We'll be able to control the Ouroboros incident in a little while.
Let's keep doing our best, Mina.
_0.11831
There's only one ruin left to activate.
Once that's done, all that's left to do is seal away Yrva Aga.
_0.11834
I'm sure Havamar will come up with something,
I can't let my guard down.
_0.11837
Come to think of it, after sealing Yurva Aga,
Will we be able to go back to our original times?
_0.11840
I think that possibility is high.
I called you to replenish the song energy in the ruins,
If you can fulfill your role, I'm sure...
_0.11843
I'm fine with it as is, though.
I was able to become friends with everyone.
_0.11846
Haha, I know, I know.
But I also want to meet my mom and dad.
_0.11849
by the way…….
Are mom and dad coming here too?
_0.11852
Max and Miria?
If you come, me and Mylène,
I wonder which era these two people are coming from?
_0.11855
what?
_0.11858
This is a message from Mr. Brera who is scouting.
_0.11861
This is Antares 1.
S. M. S's Macross Quarter is
It's heading this way.
_0.11864
A quarter! ?
Captain Ozma and the others were also here!
_0.11867
S. M. Speaking of S Frontier branch,
It doesn't have a reputation for being full of talented people.
That's 100 people!
_0.11870
No, that doesn't seem to be the case.
The attacking force launched from the quarter,
I am taking an approach course to Gefion.
_0.11875
It's a fully loaded aircraft. Something isn't right.
It was determined that it would be difficult to intercept with the current strength.
Return to the ship once.
_0.11878
Are you trying to attack us?
_0.11881
It's like... it's definitely some kind of mistake...
Captain Ozma and his friends are doing this...!
_0.11884
I don't know the details, but
They're in a fighting stance, and we're going to intercept them too!
_0.11887
But...!
_0.11890
Even if you stay here, you won't understand anything!
_0.11893
Hey, I understand!
_0.11896
Mr. Alto.
Brothers would never do something like this!
There must be some reason...
_0.11899
Ranka...
I know. I'll check the truth!
_0.11902
Mr. Alto... Please, thanks.
_0.11905
Let's go! Alto!
_0.11908
Ahh! !
_0.11911
Navigate to where Macross Quarter is currently located.
_0.11914
Understood!
I need you to explain what you mean!
_0.11917
What... is this song...! ?
_0.11920
This song has entered people's hearts...!
_0.11923
Kadun! A horrifying curse song that takes shape from people's evil hearts!
Cover your ears! Otherwise, from holes all over the body,
The witch Kadun will enter and turn your heart into a shadow!
_0.11926
Lion!
We confirmed many aircraft taking off from the quarter!
_0.11929
This is S. M. S Frontier, belongs to Skull Platoon,
This is Major Ozma Lee.
_0.11932
Notice to all traitors who defy Havamar to surrender immediately.
_0.11935
Even Havamar! ?
_0.11938
What are you talking about, Captain?
Why, Havamar! ?
_0.11941
big brother! !
what happened? ?
_0.11944
...It seems like they have no intention of surrendering.
Start the attack.
_0.11947
Big brother! ! ! !
_0.11950
Damn it! Aren't you on our side? ?
It can't be helped, let's start the interception! !
_0.11953
The fold wave of the song is
S. M. They're interfering with the S-Skull platoon's aircraft! ?
Is this possible! ?
_0.11956
This song is...Sharon Apple!
It has the power to control the human heart itself.
The ultimate virtual idol.
_0.11959
If Isamu and I are in this world and Myun is in the enemy's hands,
It wouldn't be strange if Sharon was there!
_0.11962
be careful!
Her songs have the power to brainwash people!
The Macross Quarter crew is in Sharon's hands!
_0.11965
Shoot down an enemy aircraft.
_0.11968
Shoot down enemy aircraft.
_0.11973
Michelle! Luka! Captain Krang!
Can't you hear my voice?
_0.11976
It's not in a good condition!
Alto, concentrate on the battle now!
_0.11979
Any further combat is considered dangerous.
Return to Macross Quarter.
_0.11984
It was decided that further combat would be dangerous.
Return to Macross Quarter.
_0.11989
Did you retreat? ?
what? No matter what, it's too early to retreat...
Is it a trap...?
_0.11992
everyone…….
_0.11995
Lion! Please be careful!
Macross Quarter is transforming and approaching!
_0.11998
hey hey! That's a tough joke!
How can a Valkyrie compete with a quarterweight?
_0.12001
Furthermore, we confirmed an aircraft approaching at high speed from behind the quarter!
_0.12004
Will it still come out? ?
_0.12007
I don't know how far these doll-like people can go...
It's for the future! I want you guys to fall!
_0.12010
Ivanov, Nora!
This is a strict order from Commander Todo not to hurt Mina.
_0.12013
I know!
I'm not giving orders every time!
_0.12016
Let's go, Nora.
I have to deal with young children.
_0.12019
Those guys who were driving the old model the other day!
The Macross Quarter guys alone were troublesome...!
_0.12022
That aircraft is Shin! ?
_0.12025
Shin? Is it really Shin? !
_0.12028
I can't believe Shin was taken in by Kadun like that...!
_0.12031
Their movements are different from those from before!
Maybe these guys aren't brainwashed?
_0.12034
Shin...!
_0.12037
I won't accept that kind of future...world!
For that reason, I have no choice but to fight!
_0.12040
future?
Maybe you're using Yurva Aga...!
_0.12043
Damn it! Temporarily withdrawing!
_0.12046
There's no point in doing more than this.
Return to ship.
_0.12049
Tsk, you're doing quite well, aren't you?
I'm heading back to the ship!
_0.12052
Shit, the song is even interfering with my sensor!
Aisha, what should I do! ?
_0.12055
It's too dangerous to continue fighting like this.
We need to leave the battlefield and think about countermeasures!
_0.12058
Omega 1, I understand.
If you lose your cool now, you'll lose.
Myun, I will definitely come back to help! Please wait!
_0.12061
Captain Ozma and the others are just being neglected!
_0.12064
Recognize the situation calmly, Skull 4.
There is no way to undo the brainwashing,
Are you planning to go head-on with the Quarter?
_0.12067
Damn...!
_0.12070
I understand your desire to save your friends, but now it's time to retreat!
_0.12073
Understood....
_0.12076
...Did you bite?
I guess this is the level of brainwashed people...
_0.12079
Ivanov and Nora say this is a war, but...
What am I doing?
Is this song really what I wanted to protect?
_0.12082
But that's what you wanted, right?
Shin Kudo....
_0.12085
know!
Damn it, disappear, you monster!
_0.12090
Somehow I managed to escape to a safe area...
_0.12093
I never expected my brothers to become my enemies...
_0.12096
It's not like we've become enemies sincerely.
Do it shakitto.
It’s not just Ranka-chan, Alto too!
_0.12099
Ah...I know.
I have to help everyone...!
_0.12102
Why did Shin go to Havamar...?
_0.12105
The three people who were on that old model were
Did they move differently than the guys in the quarter?
_0.12108
Well, I don't think Shin was brainwashed.
Shin is possessed by Kadun...
_0.12111
Shin is cooperating with Havamar of his own will...
_0.12114
Shin... what are you worrying about...?
_0.12117
Lion.
If we just run away like this, we won't be able to save the captains.
I have to find a way to break the brainwashing...!
_0.12120
I understand.
_0.12123
First of all, what is Sharon Apple?
A virtual idol from a long time ago has such power?
_0.12126
The biggest scandal in the history of the New Joint Forces, which is not generally known.
Sharon Apple Incident.
_0.12129
A single AI controlled Macross City, along with the new unified army.
The incident was treated as a top secret within the military.
_0.12132
Sharon's songs influence people unconsciously,
It has the power to directly control mental activity itself.
This is the end of subliminal technology that excites the audience.
_0.12135
Due to the suicide of developer Marge Gouldore,
A phantom system that was thought to never be restored.
That's what Sharon Apple used.
_0.12138
Here's my guess,
That phantom system has transcended time and space to this planet.
_0.12141
However, it wasn't perfect.
I needed the emotion that forms the basis of AI, the very heart of the song.
_0.12144
Is that Myun?
_0.12147
yes. The legendary singer who once won the Newcomer Award,
Myung van loan. make her part of the system
By incorporating, Sharon puts her heart into her songs.
_0.12150
Havamar was investigating Mr. Mun.
That's what it was for.
_0.12153
For now, I understand why the guys in the Quarter are being manipulated.
But the question is how to break the brainwashing...
_0.12156
If you knew that, you wouldn't have to worry so much.
_0.12159
…that's right.
_0.12162
Can't you cancel out Sharon's song with the power of song?
Those who are controlled by Protodevil,
When I made them listen to songs, their brainwashing was lifted.
_0.12165
At present, there is too little data to make a judgment.
_0.12168
Even if a song could break the brainwashing,
It requires a huge amount of singing energy.
I don't know if the divas that are here now are enough...
_0.12171
...What should I do?
_0.12174
Ah, already! What is Basara doing at a time like this?
I feel like if Basara was there, things would be fine!
_0.12177
yeah? Basara?
Basara has that spiky hair,
Are you talking about the guy who can sing anywhere with just a guitar?
_0.12180
picture? Um, yeah, but...
How do you know?
_0.12183
Actually, before I came to you,
That guy named Basara in the Yuria Archipelago
I have been indebted to you.
_0.12186
I certainly felt that I was not free, but
That he was from the past, just like us...
_0.12189
Whaaaaaaaat! ?
already!
Why can't you tell me something important like that?
_0.12192
Don't be so rude, Mylène.
It's weird that Teru and the others know about Basara.
_0.12195
Also, I actually didn't tell Mylène either,
I met Basara once in the Yuria Archipelago.
_0.12198
eh!
I met Leon too! ?
Why didn't you tell me! Stupid!
_0.12201
But now we've found a clue to Basara.
If I'm going to fight Sharon through song, I'll need his power.
_0.12204
Yeah!
This time, I'll find it and take care of it!
_0.12207
Well then, Akira.
Can I ask you to tell me where it was at that time?
He's not an inconspicuous guy. I'm good at finding people on this planet.
_0.12212
First, let's head to the Yuria Archipelago.
I also want to hear Basara's song again.
_0.12215
Wait! Basara!
_0.12218
I know you're happy to meet Basara, but
Calm down a bit, Mylène.
_0.12221
I'm angry!
I'm not happy about it! !
_0.12224
I had no idea that Teru met Basara.
_0.12227
Honestly, I'm sorry for telling you so late.
But Basara said he would stay here for the time being.
I'm sure we'll meet.
_0.12230
You'll understand when you go.
Let's hurry!
_0.12233
Basara should be here...
_0.12236
...That's not good.
_0.12239
Isn't that strange?
I heard you'll be here for a while...
_0.12242
Too! That’s the kind of guy he is, Basara!
It’s always like this!
_0.12245
I caught the reaction on my radar!
Lion! Looks like a customer has arrived!
_0.12248
customer? It's not Basara, right?
_0.12251
That means Havamar has attacked!
I'll put Basara on the back burner. let's go!
_0.12254
Dancing Skull from Diamond Leader.
There are no hot air spots nearby.
_0.12257
Blue Skull understands.
Move to phase 2. Eliminate the rebel elements.
_0.12260
Let's go.
_0.12263
Hey, wait!
That's not Mr. Gamlin!
And mom and dad are there too!
_0.12266
Mylène, it's dangerous!
They're already ready for battle!
_0.12269
To my surprise, all three of them were sung by Sharon...! ?
Mr. Gamlin! Daddy! Mom!
_0.12272
If we don't do anything, we will be defeated!
_0.12275
Something like that...
_0.12278
I never expected it to be like this,
I never thought I'd be reunited with Max and the others...
_0.12281
The ace pilot of the Macross 7 fleet,
Just two people defeated a rebellion on the frontier.
“Dancing Skull”?
_0.12284
Don't let your guard down!
Siegfried 1 begins interception!
_0.12287
As expected of a veteran ace!
You have good hands!
_0.12290
Mr. Gamlin, wake up!
_0.12293
Well done, Max!
No matter how old you get, your genius is still alive!
_0.12296
Hey, I don't have time to praise my enemy!
_0.12299
Mama!
Come to your senses!
_0.12302
...shoot down an enemy aircraft.
_0.12305
Mama! !
_0.12308
forever and ever,
I can't afford to fight like this...!
_0.12311
I can't afford to shoot it down!
If we don't do something, there will be no more...!
_0.12314
Already… Papa, Mama, and Mr. Gamlin…!
Being used for good by Havamar...!
_0.12317
...It's more tenacious than expected, but
Let me put a stop to it now.
_0.12320
roger that.
Captain Gamlin, continue.
_0.12323
Aaaaaaa! already!
Mom and Dad really don't understand!
_0.12326
It's okay, my song will bring you back to your senses! !
_0.12329
Listen to my song! !
_0.12332
This song...?
_0.12335
what……! ?
_0.12338
Millet...nu...?
_0.12341
Maybe Mylène's song is getting rid of the brainwashing! ?
_0.12344
Is it because we are no longer within the effective range of Sharon's song...?
_0.12347
wrong!
Mylene's feelings...
The power of singing is being conveyed!
_0.12350
Leon, destroy the remaining enemies!
_0.12355
The rest of the enemies are pretty much taken care of.
_0.12358
It seems like Max and the others have returned to their senses.
Phew, you really made me waste time.
_0.12361
here……?
Hey, Mylène! ?
Why Mylène-san? ?
_0.12364
Hmm...why am I riding a Valkyrie?
_0.12367
…here?
What on earth was I doing...?
_0.12370
Hey, it's been a while.
Max, Miria.
_0.12373
It's been a while...
_0.12376
! ? Could it be... Ichijo-kun?
Why are you here, Ichijou? ?
Her appearance hasn't changed at all from before!
_0.12379
If I may say so,
You haven't changed at all...
_0.12382
If you're already Mr. Gamlin,
I had been brainwashed again.
_0.12385
I-I'm sorry. Mylene-san...
_0.12388
I think it's good that the story blooms,
Would you like to talk calmly after you return?
_0.12391
Yeah, I'll let you do that.
_0.12394
I see... I understand the general situation.
Looks like I caused you trouble.
_0.12397
please do not worry.
Don't you remember when you were at Havamar?
_0.12400
When they asked me to cooperate, I refused.
I remember though... I don't remember anything beyond that.
_0.12403
Those who do not cooperate,
So, they were brainwashed by Sharon's song?
_0.12406
I was really, really worried!
All three of you know!
_0.12409
Sorry, Mylene.
From now on, I will protect you as much as Basara.
_0.12412
I, along with Miria, will be cooperating with you guys.
_0.12415
I'm a little older now, but
Thank you for your continued support in this day and age, Max.
_0.12418
I'm glad we were able to bring Captain Max and his friends back to their senses, but...
In the end, I couldn't find Basara.
_0.12421
But, thanks to Mylène,
I've started to see Sharon's breakthrough in singing.
_0.12424
I'm also curious about Basara,
If that's the case, now the only way out is to bet on him.
_0.12427
Lion!
I found a countermeasure to Sharon's song!
_0.12430
As expected of Aisha!
You work fast as usual.
_0.12433
Hehe.
This time, thanks to Captain Max's advice.
_0.12436
I am Aisha-kun and Grace-kun.
I just came up with an answer based on data.
_0.12439
With this "Sound Buster",
It should be able to compete with Sharon's song.
_0.12442
This also happened during the battle with Protodeviln.
That's the system I used.
_0.12445
Because the principle was the secret of secrets,
Thank goodness Captain Max had the data.
_0.12448
This will also help those who are brainwashed by Sharon.
_0.12451
Hmm. But it doesn't work that well.
Creation seems to be going smoothly,
Important parts are missing.
_0.12454
Hey, I've come this far and that's it...
_0.12457
I hope you can rest assured about that too.
The Havamar base where we were brainwashed was
It was an experimental facility for song energy.
_0.12460
What do you mean?
_0.12463
Ahh.
There is a high possibility that the parts you need are there.
_0.12466
If that's the case, leave it to me.
I'll go get those parts right now.
_0.12469
I'm sorry, but I'll have to go with you.
Apparently that's the base where Myun was being held prisoner.
_0.12472
No problem.
Well then, let's go when you're ready, Garudo.
_0.12475
It was left in our aircraft,
I sent you the location of the base.
_0.12478
roger that. confirm.
_0.12481
Thank you for manipulating us and doing what you wanted.
I'll make sure to give it back.
_0.12484
Oh, scary, scary.
Maximilian Genus, who is famous for being a genius,
I don't want to be your enemy again.
_0.12487
The system that is the basis of Sound Buster,
"Sound Energy System" developed by Dr. Chiba .
_0.12490
Higher universe... Vibrating the fold space with song energy,
A system that converts it into physical energy.
However, I don't really understand the rationale.
_0.12493
If this means I can get along with that Sharon,
Reason doesn't matter.
_0.12496
This is the target base.
I wish I had the parts...
_0.12499
You won't know until you go.
Leon, let's go.
_0.12502
For the base of Havamar,
There's little resistance...
_0.12505
I wonder if Sharon's defense or another plan is in progress.
I don't know about that, but I guess the staff is being allocated.
_0.12508
For them, Sharon is their trump card.
If you've been brainwashed into liking her, you won't be able to get close to her.
_0.12511
If that's the case,
I definitely have to get the parts here.
_0.12514
Shit, where is it?
_0.12517
Don't worry, Leon.
It should be in the base here, let's go inside.
_0.12520
Is this a dead end?
_0.12523
No, that's not true.
Leon, activate the switch on the wall over there.
_0.12526
yeah? Is it here?
_0.12529
Is it a hidden door?
As expected from the BDI system.
Can you even feel such a weak signal?
_0.12532
He also reads the inspiration and instincts of the human body.
Too sensitive,
It seems that it was not installed in the model adopted by Gamlin and his friends.
_0.12535
That's all for the explanation. let's go.
_0.12538
There it was! This is it!
_0.12541
Ahh.
Now you can help Myun...!
_0.12544
If I can't help Myun,
Because I don't have a face that matches his.
_0.12547
that person?
_0.12550
Hehe, don't worry.
Let's say we return.
_0.12553
Yes, this is it!
If you have this part,
I can complete the sound buster!
_0.12556
I'll start working on it right away.
When it's completed, I'll get revenge on Sharon.
_0.12559
Now everyone in the quarter,
It should be possible to free yourself from brainwashing.
_0.12562
Alright!
We are also preparing for the revenge battle against Sharon.
I need to get ready...!
_0.12565
Now, let's go back to Madis Glacier!
_0.12568
Lion!
Macross Quarter is approaching!
_0.12571
I guess I was being watched...
Looks like they're going to settle things before completing Soundbuster.
_0.12574
Damn it!
Even if I fought against the captains,
If this continues, the result will be the same as before...!
_0.12577
Are you okay!
It was a bit sudden, but
The sound buster is completed!
_0.12580
With this, you can't beat Sharon's song!
_0.12583
As expected of Aisha!
Now all that's left is to have everyone put on a passionate live performance.
_0.12586
I will never let you interfere with your live performance!
Sing your heart out, Sheryl! Ranka!
_0.12589
Even if you don't tell me, I'll sing at full throttle!
There's me, Ranka-chan, and Minmei and the others.
There's no way I'll fail!
_0.12592
That's right, Alto!
I'll try my best to sing.
Let's definitely save our brothers! !
_0.12595
Ah!
_0.12598
Well then, let's go with Revenge.
Wait, Sharon, this time it won't be like before!
_0.12601
Well, we can't lose this battle!
_0.12604
I know!
let's go! everyone! !
_0.12607
Macross Quarter and S. M. Confirm S Skull platoon.
_0.12610
In addition, check out the fold wave by Sharon's song!
However, the source of the song has not yet been determined.
_0.12613
Until the sound buster starts,
Stop them!
_0.12618
Sorry for the wait! Preparations for startup are complete!
Divas, are you ready?
_0.12621
Leave it to me!
How can our singing be better than a machine?
_0.12624
I will deliver the song to my brothers!
_0.12627
Let's go!
Sound Buster activated!
_0.12630
Confirm the activation of Sound Buster!
_0.12633
The quarter has stopped moving!
It's going well!
I'll undo the brainwashing! !
_0.12636
Come to your senses, everyone! !
_0.12639
Come back to your senses, Captain Ozma! !
_0.12644
Alto...?
_0.12647
Come on, come back to your senses! Michelle! !
_0.12654
Luka! ! Wake up!
_0.12659
Alto-senpai...?
_0.12662
Wake up! Captain Krang! !
_0.12669
Please come to your senses! Captain Jeffrey! !
_0.12674
Lieutenant Alto...?
_0.12677
The brainwashing is gone! ?
_0.12680
It's a little rough, but
Looks like I need to give you a shock.
_0.12683
It's all thanks to the songs of divas.
_0.12686
Alright!
Let's free everyone from Sharon!
_0.12689
If we keep going like this, we might be able to take back the quarter!
_0.12692
eh! That’s it…!
Sharon's singing energy is increasing...!
_0.12695
That is! A large Vajra ship! ?
Havamar even has things like this...!
_0.12698
Also check out the large amount of bajra!
Is that an implant bullet?
No, it's directly controlled by Sharon's song!
_0.12701
Such...Using the Vajra ship's upper network,
They say Sharon's song is controlling Vajra! ?
_0.12704
You must be kidding…!
_0.12707
Something like this...!
_0.12710
Chicksho! !
_0.12713
Even with this, I still don't have enough energy to sing...!
_0.12716
Grace and I will start hacking!
I have to weaken Sharon's power even a little...!
_0.12719
Damn it!
I have no choice but to fight now! ?
_0.12722
The song energy value is increasing...!
_0.12725
quarter crew,
Sharon's brainwashing is completely gone!
_0.12728
big brother!
_0.12731
Ranka! ? Who am I...?
_0.12734
As expected, it's so hot!
Now if we can destroy Sharon's body...!
_0.12737
Alright!
I'm going to fight back!
_0.12740
...After all, he's a brainwashed pilot,
Looks like I'm no match for them.
I guess I have no choice but to do it...!
_0.12743
If Todo's words are true, in order to grasp our future,
This is the only way to do it.
_0.12746
You don't want a future like that, do you?
_0.12749
I know! I know!
In order to protect Mayan Island, I...!
_0.12752
That aircraft! ?
_0.12755
Shin! Shin Kudo, I bet you can hear me!
Why! You're not brainwashed,
Why do you become our enemy? Sara and Mao are there too!
_0.12758
I didn't become Sara's enemy!
I just want to change the future where the earth is destroyed!
_0.12761
The Earth will be destroyed...is this an interstellar war?
_0.12764
That's it!
If you could show me something like that...
If I could change the future of destruction with the power of the ruins, I would...!
_0.12767
Damn……….
_0.12770
Shin...
What a stupid Kadun you are
I'm possessed!
_0.12773
Sara! ?
_0.12776
This world may be our future.
However, there may be a different ending.
_0.12779
And no matter how painful the future may be,
We can live there without despair.
_0.12782
That's right, Shin!
My grandson is also on this ship!
_0.12785
rewrite the past,
It would be too selfish to pretend this world never existed!
_0.12788
I...I just want the earth that doesn't shake...!
I just want to leave it to everyone!
_0.12791
What kind of weak words are you talking about?
I couldn't hear what grandma said! ?
_0.12794
Your world time and
There is no guarantee that our time will be the same!
Time and space are vague things!
_0.12797
This is how we met again.
There must be a meaning behind this phantom-like encounter.
_0.12800
Recall!
Shin is...
Shin is not a pawn of the bad guys! ?
_0.12803
I am……!
_0.12806
What are you doing, Skull 2? Shoot!
Will you choose a future where the Earth is destroyed by these silly giants?
_0.12809
That's why I won't help you kill people any more!
What Havamar is doing is not war, it's just terrorism!
I will no longer collaborate with terrorists!
_0.12812
Shin!
_0.12815
I'll lend you a hand, Siegfried 1!
_0.12818
Tch, this is why Hiyoko...!
_0.12821
I thought that's what that kid would do.
_0.12824
Well, that's fine.
The variable fighter dogfight was established by
We'll drive it into your bones that we are an anti-integration alliance!
_0.12827
Tch, the color of the flag is bad.
Nora, that's all there is to helping Havamar.
I'm going to retreat.
_0.12830
Understood , D.D. ! _
_0.12833
Goodbye, boy.
I'll let you do your own thing.
If we ever meet again, I'll tear you to pieces!
_0.12836
Thank you. I welcome your withdrawal.
This allowed us to reduce the enemy's strength, but
We have to do something about Sharon!
_0.12839
Sharon's body is
It is installed inside the Vajra quasi-queen ship!
_0.12842
Hold back with Brera and others and open the way!
Leon, head towards Sharon's body! !
_0.12847
Damn it!
It must be tough to fly through this...!
_0.12850
But I can't give up here! !
_0.12853
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee !
_0.12856
YF-29! ?
That coloring...!
_0.12859
What a crazy way to fly!
There is no theory or anything...!
_0.12862
Huh...that was late.
I've already cleaned up most of the food for the banquet.
...Isamu.
_0.12865
Ha, Temee as always,
It's a principle of leaving your favorite food until the end.
I'll have the main dish!
_0.12868
Huh, you can't do that.
_0.12871
Nukase!
I'll tell you the story later!
_0.12874
Siegfried 1, follow me!
Let's save Myun!
_0.12877
Understood!
I thought you were alive.
He’ll make a flashy appearance! Don't be late!
_0.12880
You've finally come.
I'm tired of waiting...
_0.12883
Sharon Apple!
I came to get Myun back!
_0.12886
It looks good on you, Isamu.
This little bitch isn't what you want, is it?
What is your true desire...
_0.12889
Don't leave out the mess!
_0.12892
We fly the way we want to fly!
That's it!
_0.12895
Although I am grateful for having saved my life,
I'll pay you back as an enemy!
_0.12898
Hehe...! I like that kind of Isamu...
_0.12901
It's strange...I feel extremely satisfied.
A song that I didn't know before I got emotions...
_0.12904
That’s your audience, Sharon!
_0.12907
Audience...audience?
Did I need something like that?
_0.12910
That's it! Because there is an audience that listens to songs,
It will grow louder, resonate with each other, and ignite the flames even more!
If there is no one to share your heart with, the song will die!
_0.12913
You were singing for me?
Not for the sake of the warriors I captured...
_0.12916
Did I tell you? Listen to my song!
It doesn't matter that it's AI. You are a great singer.
That's fine, right?
_0.12919
A mysterious man....
Let's meet again someday, beyond the sea of folds...
_0.12922
Sharon...
You finally found the meaning of singing...
_0.12925
Isamu…Gard….
I…….
_0.12928
More on that later!
Let's escape!
_0.12931
Is it finished...?
_0.12934
It is confirmed that Sharon's mother system is down.
_0.12937
Vajra also ruled by Sharon's song,
It seems like I was able to get out of it.
_0.12940
Now, Vajra will also be good for Havamar.
It means you won't be manipulated.
_0.12943
Ah, Isamu and his friends are back too.
_0.12946
Let's go back to the ship and calm down.
As expected, I was exhausted this time.
_0.12949
Thank you both.
I feel like I was having a really bad dream.
_0.12952
Don't worry about it.
You should try everything before you think about it.
_0.12955
Was it Shin?
So are you.
_0.12958
...That's right. Might be so.
_0.12961
What is the way to live in Nantoka without falling?
It doesn't suit us. After kicking and stumbling,
You just have to think about how to stand up.
_0.12964
When you say that you always make me wipe my ass,
It's heavy.
_0.12967
It's annoying.
_0.12970
It's true...you guys haven't changed...
_0.12973
But I also remembered. Thanks to Basara and you guys.
_0.12976
That songs need an audience.
For someone, with the feelings you want to convey...
To me, it was the two of you...
_0.12979
Captain Ozma!
Michelle! Luke and Captain Krang too!
_0.12982
Looks like you're doing well, Alto.
Oh, I'm sorry for worrying you.
_0.12985
I'm sorry, Alto-senpai.
I never expected to be manipulated by Sharon...
_0.12988
It really helped me this time.
_0.12991
big brother!
I was really worried! stupid stupid!
_0.12994
I'm sorry it seems like I put you through a lot of trouble, Ranka...
I'll protect you properly from now on.
_0.12997
big brother…….
_0.13000
So, Alto...
I heard that Nekki Basara is coming...?
_0.13003
If it were him, he would have gone somewhere after he finished singing.
_0.13006
Hey! ?
Well, there's still a chance to get an autograph...
_0.13009
Captain...Isn't there something more important?
_0.13012
Ah, ah, that's right.
In cooperation with Ouroboros branch,
I need to pay back my debt to Havamar!
_0.13015
………………!
_0.13018
Sorry, both of you.
_0.13021
I was really worried!
_0.13024
……What happened?
_0.13027
From Commander Todo of Havamar,
I was shown a video of the Earth being destroyed...
_0.13030
The appearance of the devastated earth is
I wouldn't have believed it if the familiar aircraft carrier wasn't in the picture...
_0.13033
An attack by aliens called the Zentraedi burns down the entire Earth...
The damage was incomparable to the Macross fall.
_0.13036
Know.
The era we are in now is
That's far into the future.
_0.13039
Of course I didn't believe it at first.
But I was shown a lot of evidence,
I had to believe it was true.
_0.13042
Is that why you cooperated with Havamar?
_0.13045
ah. Commander Todo is
With the power of Yrva Aga,
He said that the tragedies of the past and future will disappear.
_0.13048
There are no Zentraedi who destroyed Earth.
A world where no one will be threatened again.
We want to create a world where nature is completely restored on Earth.
_0.13051
How arrogant...!
_0.13054
But Sara and Mao's voices drew me back.
_0.13057
Even in the future of destruction,
There is no peace that can be obtained by eliminating those who are different from you.
It's just a repetition of denial.
_0.13060
Yes Yes!
_0.13063
Sigh...
got it. I'll forgive you just this time.
_0.13066
thank you.
I don't know what I can do, but I'll do what I can.
Maybe that's what it means to be a pilot.
_0.13069
Jeffrey Wilder, Captain of Macross Quarter.
Once again, S. M. I would like to thank all the staff at the S Ouroboros branch.
_0.13072
No, no.
S., who is known for his skill. M. S Frontier branch
I'm honored to be able to help.
_0.13075
Honestly, I thought I was going to die.
_0.13078
This is not an apology, but we will cooperate with you.
The dangers of Havamar are all too familiar.
_0.13081
Yes, thank you very much.
_0.13084
Now all you have to do is activate the final ruin...!
_0.13087
Yeah.
You can seal Yrva Aga away.
_0.13090
Commander Todo.
Sharon Apple stopped functioning,
Songstress Myung Phan Loon was robbed.
_0.13093
After all, that's the limit for mechanical songs.
But it was enough to buy me some time.
_0.13096
Furthermore, the quarter crew was brainwashed by Sharon.
and Shin Kudo join Rion Sakaki.
_0.13099
D. D. Ivanov and Nora Polyansky.
He's MIA, but I wonder if he escaped...
_0.13102
Kudo was disappointed.
I thought he would agree with my purpose...
It seems that I have not come close to understanding the noble purpose.
_0.13105
Lion, Sakaki and the others will now activate the sixth ruin,
He will take action to seal away Yrva Aga.
_0.13108
That's right. Let's let them work until the end.
As long as we hold the trump card, it doesn't matter.
_0.13111
We are also in the final preparations.
Rod, let's head to Yrva Aga.
_0.13116
(I have no choice but to continue down this path.
This is all I have...! )
_0.13119
Remains?
Does that mean I need to start it?
_0.13122
yes.
Ask Myun to activate the sixth ruin,
If I could seal away the main body, Yurva Aga...
_0.13125
Everything is resolved. That's the story.
Okay okay.
_0.13128
Well, let's head to the ruins right away!
Let's go, Myun.
_0.13131
Hey, wait, Isamu.
Why are you going with Myun?
I'll take you.
_0.13134
Ahh? Why are you saying something I don't understand?
Because you're insecure,
He said I'd do it for him.
_0.13139
Eh, erm, why did we get into a fight...?
_0.13142
Let's leave those idiots alone and go.
Nice to meet you, Mina-chan.
_0.13145
Ha, yes! thank you!
But what about those two...?
_0.13148
You don't have to worry about it.
_0.13151
Huh...is that so...?
_0.13154
I bought high school lunch twice!
_0.13157
I was made to treat myself 13 times!
_0.13160
How long have you guys been doing this...?
If this continues, I'll really die.
_0.13163
There is a possibility that Havamar will move at this timing.
Stay alert.
_0.13166
Understood.
I won't let you lay a finger on Mina or Myun!
_0.13169
How are you doing? Aisha?
_0.13172
There is no noticeable movement in Havamar at the moment.
_0.13175
Really.
In that case, I have to finish it quickly before I get in the way.
_0.13178
We have arrived at our destination ruins.
I leave it to you, Mina, Myun!
_0.13183
I got it.
_0.13186
I'm with you, there's nothing dangerous about it.
_0.13189
Thanks to your reckless actions,
I wonder how many times I put Myun in danger!
Myun is with me. You should return to the ship quickly!
_0.13192
Oh my god!
_0.13195
Let's go!
_0.13198
We get along so well that we fight.
...That's fine, right?
These two people...
_0.13201
It would be nice to sing deep inside these ruins.
_0.13204
Yes, it is.
_0.13207
I wonder if my song is really okay...
_0.13210
Myun-san is definitely fine!
_0.13213
Thank you, Mina-chan.
_0.13216
Apparently, Havamar is
It doesn't seem like anything has been set up in this sixth ruin.
_0.13219
The real thing begins after you activate the sixth ruin.
_0.13222
As soon as you activate the ruins here,
There's no way that Yrva Aga will start up, right?
_0.13225
I tried to think of the worst case scenario.
Without Mina, Yrva Aga
You can't control it.
_0.13228
Understood.
Well then, let's quickly activate the ruins here as well.
_0.13231
There are some pretty interesting monsters with protective weapons, right?
Garudo, let's compete to see who can kill the most.
_0.13234
Well, I already know the result.
_0.13237
In the end, are they good friends?
_0.13240
Are you okay, Myun?
_0.13243
Eh, it's okay, Garudo.
_0.13246
Myun said it was okay. Let's go quickly.
_0.13249
I never expected the three of us to go exploring together like this again.
That's what I'm going to do.
_0.13252
Huh, sure.
_0.13255
You can do this anytime.
Even if we go back to the original era, wouldn't it be enough for the three of us to meet again?
_0.13258
Yeah, that's right...
_0.13261
Is this the destination?
_0.13264
yes. I will link to the ruins from now on.
Please sing while thinking of Myun's loved ones...
_0.13267
important person?
_0.13270
I got it…….
_0.13273
(Isamu…Gard……………)
_0.13276
Myun's song comes to me...
_0.13283
I understand Myun-san's feelings.
_0.13286
Phew, it's been a while since I sang it, but I wonder how it was.
Isamu, Garud?
_0.13289
Hey, I was as bad as ever.
_0.13294
...But I remembered the old days.
The scenery of that hill that the three of us saw...
_0.13297
Myun….
I said I'd protect you forever, and it's still the same now.
_0.13300
thank you. Isamu. Garde...
_0.13303
...It's nice to have childhood friends.
I wish we could laugh together like we used to...
_0.13306
With this, the activation of the sixth ruin is complete.
_0.13309
All that's left now is the seal of Yrva Aga.
_0.13312
Ah, there are preparations. Let's go back to the ship.
_0.13315
This will replenish the energy of the six ruins,
Everything started!
_0.13318
Then, with the help of the songstress,
Just seal away Yrva Aga.
_0.13321
Let's make it the best live show!
_0.13324
When this happens, the question is how to get there.
_0.13327
Havamar... What is Todo thinking...?
_0.13330
If the other person does not come towards you,
We just have to start from here, right?
I'll take the lead.
_0.13333
There are so many divas and their knights.
This is fine. I'm sure it'll work out!
_0.13336
yes! I will sing with all my might!
_0.13339
Good for you, Mina.
_0.13342
Thank you, Leon...
_0.13345
I... After sealing Yurva Aga,
I want to do many things with Leon!
_0.13348
Ah, when it's all over.
I promise.
_0.13351
Yes! I'm looking forward to it!
_0.13354
Leon, are you okay?
_0.13357
Before the last big thing,
What kind of crazy thing are you going to do this time?
_0.13360
When did I let you do that?
I don't remember anything like that.
_0.13363
Hey hey.
That's probably what's going on inside you...
_0.13366
Hehe, it looks like you're not nervous.
_0.13369
Well.
It is true that Yrva Aga can create the world.
It might be amazing, but...
_0.13372
What we do is simple.
Destroy Havamar and seal away Yrva Aga.
That’s it, right?
_0.13375
That's right...
That's why, in order to do our best,
I want to make final adjustments to the YF-30.
_0.13378
I also checked it.
The problem area has been resolved.
It is possible to put it into practice right now.
_0.13381
I would be reassuring if I had that aircraft.
So let's get started right away.
_0.13384
Well, please help me.
_0.13387
Hmm... here...?
_0.13390
Leon-san, are you okay?
_0.13393
When...
_0.13396
You still have to lie down!
_0.13399
...Mina! And Aisha! ?
Damn...
_0.13402
It's like being given a powerful anesthetic.
Stop being so reckless.
_0.13405
Damn it!
If only I had noticed earlier!
_0.13408
Lion.
I'm sorry, but the situation hasn't been sorted out yet.
What the hell happened?
_0.13411
The captains are gathering in the quarter.
Could you please explain it to me?
_0.13414
Ahh…. Understood...!
_0.13417
The case with Branch Manager Aisha was unfortunate.
I had no idea that she had been captured by Havamar.
_0.13420
That was careless.
From the implant net, which has a different system than me,
That I was being controlled...
_0.13423
It was probably developed within the New Joint Forces.
Implant technology to subjugate the Zentraedi.
_0.13426
Finally,
Their technology cannot control the ego itself,
The project should have been scrapped...
_0.13429
That means Todo continued his research.
_0.13432
…Aisha is...
It hasn't completely fallen into Havamar's hands!
_0.13435
He said he wanted me to help him!
_0.13438
If he still has consciousness,
I'm sure I can help you!
No, I'll definitely help you out!
_0.13441
Of course, Leon.
Yurva Aga by Todo as it is
I can't let it start.
_0.13444
Data scan around Havamar base has been completed.
It appears that a large number of troops are deployed around the base.
_0.13447
Now, we S. M. S is in the name of rescuing Special Forces Major Aisha.
I'm planning on assaulting the Havamar base, but...
Lieutenant Lyon, what should you do?
_0.13450
Mina was also kidnapped.
I can't just wait and do nothing!
_0.13453
Of course I'll take off!
And I will definitely rescue these two! !
_0.13456
If not.
Let's go, you bastards!
I'll show Havamar something! !
_0.13459
Please wait, Mina, Aisha...
_0.13462
The target, Havamar base, has been confirmed.
_0.13465
That's the enemy's base.
Thank you for using me as you wish,
I have to thank you very much!
_0.13468
To be able to fight alongside the legendary Milia like this,
It really feels like a dream...
_0.13471
Clan, I know you're excited, but
If you're not careful, you'll get hit!
_0.13474
Hmm, Michelle is such a cheeky person!
It seems that we need to re-educate them as to which is better.
_0.13477
Hehe, it's nice to be young...
_0.13480
Currently, Havamar's troops are
It seems like there are a lot of them around the base.
The defense near the gate at the rear of the ruins is weak.
_0.13483
Aisha and Mina are at that base!
_0.13486
Now, let's go rescue the princess!
_0.13489
let's go!
Each aircraft formation! Planet dance!
_0.13492
This is the home base of Havamar!
It's going to be a fierce battle, be careful, Rion!
_0.13495
No matter if it's dangerous or not,
Aisha and Mina are over there!
_0.13498
If you run away from here, you won't have the face to match those guys!
I'll definitely protect it this time!
That's my intention! !
_0.13501
So...don't get in my way! !
_0.13504
We have enough control of the sky!
Lion! Alto!
You guys take the lead and start rushing into the base! !
_0.13507
roger that!
Let's start rushing now!
Wait, you two...!
_0.13510
This is the ruins where Fold Evil sleeps.
Yrva Aga?
_0.13513
The two should be here.
I need to find it soon!
_0.13516
Damn it, where are you two!
_0.13519
Rion, calm down.
_0.13524
What's happening!
_0.13527
I have no choice but to go deeper, so let's go.
_0.13530
It's dangerous here!
Now it's time to escape, Leon! !
_0.13533
But Aisha and Mina! !
_0.13536
Stay calm, Rion!
You won't be able to fulfill your purpose by dying here!
_0.13541
I'm sorry, Alto...
He seemed a bit foolish and lacked composure.
_0.13544
Let's go, the battle is yet to come!
Aisha and Mina are also waiting!
_0.13547
Lion!
I won't let you get in the way of my plans any longer!
_0.13550
rod!
I don't have time to be silly with you right now!
_0.13553
Even if you don't have it, we have it!
Commander Todo's dream... No, you're in the way for Mia! !
_0.13556
Woooooooooooooooo! ! ! !
_0.13559
Damn it! I guess we have no choice but to do it!
_0.13562
Where did you put Aisha and Mina, Rod!
_0.13567
Hey, Rod! Say it somehow! !
Don't be silent! !
_0.13570
I don't want to lose anyone important to me anymore...
That's why I'll definitely bring those two back! !
_0.13573
I grasp the future with Mia!
_0.13576
The same goes for me!
In order to get Mia back, I...!
_0.13579
Mia is gone!
Why can't you accept that? rod! !
_0.13582
The world where Mia died...a world that doesn't exist...
I can't admit it! !
_0.13585
That's why I want to use the power of the ruins to create a world where Mia exists! !
_0.13588
Wake up Rod!
There is no such a convenient world!
_0.13591
I always watched Mia's death calmly.
No, I was coldly trying to leave it in the past! !
_0.13594
But, I can't do that...
_0.13597
I really wanted Mia back!
That's why I entrusted myself to Commander Todo's plan! !
_0.13600
You...
_0.13603
I just wanted a reason to live...
_0.13606
I wonder if Todo's plan will come true?
Maybe it didn't matter from the beginning...
_0.13609
rod….
_0.13612
When I met you again on this Ouroboros, I remembered something.
I remember the old days when the three of us always flew together...
_0.13615
Things were good back then...
There was me, you, and Mia. That's all I am...!
_0.13618
Damn... why am I like this! !
_0.13621
rod!
_0.13624
I knew I had lost my way somewhere...
_0.13627
But I didn't have the courage to look back...
_0.13630
rod! Rebuild the aircraft! !
_0.13633
You can still try again!
Mia wants that too!
_0.13636
Those two are in a cocoon...
_0.13639
Leon... please forgive me.
I was weak...
_0.13642
rod!
Do as I say!
rod! Rod! !
_0.13645
I'm really tired...
I just excused Mia and ran away...
_0.13648
I’m sorry……Mia………….
_0.13651
Rodoooooooooooooooo! ! ! !
_0.13654
A fold magnetic field is generated around Yurva Aga!
We are currently rapidly expanding our scope.
_0.13657
this is…,
A cocoon-like fault covers the center of the base.
_0.13660
This is the power of protoculture ruins...
_0.13663
However, there is no way to overcome so many fault lines.
Does it exist for us now?
_0.13666
there is!
The YF-30 that Aisha was developing had
Equipped with a uniquely developed fold system.
_0.13669
This is currently being tested and developed at L.A.I.
It is the latest technology that has not yet been put into practical use.
_0.13672
got it.
If you drill a hole in the fault with that YF-30,
I asked you what dimensions it would take to fit inside that, Rion!
_0.13677
Lion! !
Did you hear that?
_0.13680
Ah...I heard you.
_0.13683
I know you're sad about Rod. But...!
_0.13686
Oh, I know!
I know this is not the time to be sad!
_0.13691
I have to rescue those two!
Can you stand still in a place like this?
_0.13694
Rod, you're a big idiot who went the wrong way.
So I'll go. A different path than you...a future!
_0.13697
Aisha, Mina, wait!
I'll come pick you up right now!
_0.13700
Second Lieutenant Rion, rushing will not yield any good results.
Return to Gefion and prepare for the final battle.
Please don't forget.
_0.13703
The seal has already been broken.
All that remains is to wait for the time to rebuild the world...
_0.13706
Todo! ?
Damn it, what is that huge monster?
_0.13709
Let me show you.
This new power of mine, rivaling that of God...
_0.13712
Redeem your foolishness with your death!
_0.13715
That's a quarter!
Looks like you managed to break through!
_0.13718
Lion! Is it okay?
...What is this guy?
_0.13721
No way...
That's Fold Evil! ?
_0.13724
What a Kadun...
So much for human work...
_0.13727
That... once upon a time, even the protoculture
It is the worst biological weapon that has brought it to the brink of extinction.
Evil series.
_0.13730
I never thought I would have to fight such a monster from history...
_0.13733
Are you scared, Michelle?
_0.13736
The bigger the opponent, the better!
I'll blow you away!
Yee yahoo!
_0.13739
That's how it is!
Omega 1, move to intercept!
_0.13742
Hmph, we can't lose either!
_0.13745
Each machine prepares to intercept Fold Evil!
Don't let him touch your quarters!
Formation, assault love heart!
_0.13756
be changed. It can control time and space.
Everything in this world is a dream.
I will end the nightmare that is Macross!
_0.13759
Don't joke around!
It may be a beautiful past for you, but
We've been living in this galaxy for decades!
_0.13762
The world you desire is our nightmare!
_0.13765
Why, why don't you guys understand?
That day, the world where that damn Macross never fell.
All tragedies will disappear and people will be able to live in a just world.
_0.13768
The world for your ego...
_0.13771
We are now
To pretend that this world we live in never existed,
I can't let you do it! !
_0.13774
I made a promise to Mia to protect our future peace!
Let’s go, Todo! !
_0.13777
Let's kick off with a bang! ! !
_0.13780
This is Delta 1.
Notification to Siegfried 1 and other aircraft! !
_0.13783
Aisha-chan and Mina-chan are captured
I found the location! !
_0.13786
In the capsule visible on the outside of Fold Evil,
I caught their biological reactions!
_0.13789
understood!
If you understand that!
_0.13792
Each aircraft supports Siegfried 1,
Secure your return route from Fold Evil!
_0.13795
Wait! Aisha! Mina!
I'll definitely rescue you! !
_0.13798
Aisha!
_0.13801
Lion!
What am I doing...
_0.13804
You don't have to say anything.
You were safe. That's all I need.
_0.13807
Lion...!
_0.13810
Mina!
_0.13813
Lion!
He will definitely come to help me...
I believe...
_0.13816
I promised to protect you, but I'm sorry that I couldn't.
From now on, I won't let you feel scared. absolutely….
_0.13821
This is Siegfried 1.
We succeeded in rescuing Aisha and Mina!
Return to the quarter once. Ask for guidance.
_0.13824
This is Delta 1, understood.
_0.13827
Why don't you guys understand?
Don't you want to change this distorted world?
_0.13830
The song is working!
_0.13833
…stupid! Argh!
_0.13836
Spiritia level further increased!
Through the song, Fold Evil's energy
It's going down rapidly! !
_0.13839
Hehe, I'll do it, Mina-chan.
It's a very nice song.
_0.13842
We can't lose either!
Let's go, Ranka-chan.
_0.13845
Yes, Sheryl.
_0.13848
Let’s go, everyone!
_0.13851
my…
_0.13854
Listen to our song~★
_0.13861
Woooooooooo! !
_0.13864
Look at the rebuilding of the world!
_0.13866
The deep darkness of this evil Kadun...
I won't let that darkness fall on Ouroboros.
_0.13869
Are you trying to block my path to supremacy?
_0.13872
Isamu, Garud...
Be sure to come back safely...
_0.13875
I'll do it, Minmei
_0.13877
It's a wonderful song...
I'll sing too. Go all out!
_0.13880
I want to eliminate all tragedies!
_0.13883
It resonates in my heart!
It's my first time to see such a passionate live show! ! !
_0.13886
Hey Mylène!
_0.13889
What! Basara!
_0.13892
Let's make their hearts sparkle!
_0.13895
already! The enemy is over there!
_0.13898
Okay. I'm going to play hard!
_0.13901
I'll make my song resonate throughout the galaxy! !
Let's go, fire! ! ! !
_0.13904
What's wrong with changing the world to its correct form?
_0.13907
……stupid……!
I have obtained the power of Fold Evil.
This me...! !
_0.13910
Lion!
You...you will end this battle with your hands!
_0.13913
Huh.
Well, I'll leave it to you this time.
_0.13916
Leon, you can do it!
_0.13919
I have to show you what's good about nerds.
Even if it tightens, it won't.
_0.13922
appreciate!
Defeat him and let's all return to our original world!
_0.13925
With this one blow, I'll end everything! !
_0.13928
Guaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…!
My dreams are disappearing...
The future I wanted...!
_0.13931
Everyone has gone home...
_0.13934
That's right.
I feel like I've been in a very long dream.
_0.13937
Everyone's songs were wonderful...
I want to be able to sing like that too!
_0.13940
fault? Mina, you don't have enough self-awareness.
It is now dominating the topic on the Galaxy Chart.
She's a super idol!
_0.13943
I still have a long way to go.
_0.13946
Fufufu….
There was nothing crazy in my eyes.
_0.13949
But I didn't expect Mina and me either.
I can't believe I'm going crazy over that guy.
Even with these eyes, I couldn't see through it...
_0.13952
eh?
Did you say something, Aisha?
_0.13955
Nah, it's nothing.
_0.13958
Ah, it's about time to start.
Mina's live show the other day.
_0.13961
Lion!
It's about to start!
_0.13964
Lion! quickly! quickly!
_0.13967
Oh! Let's go now!
Aisha, Mina! !
_0.13970
Leon!
Hey there! Don't make me wait until this time!
It's disqualifying to be a prince if you keep the princess waiting.
_0.13973
Really, I just don't talk much.
_0.13976
Did you say something?
_0.13979
no….
_0.13982
However, when I first came to Ouroboros,
I was wondering what would happen...
_0.13985
What are you saying! You had the best encounter!
A prince will fall from the sky,
It's a rare situation!
_0.13988
As a bonus,
He's a pilot with ace-level skills.
God must have granted my wish.
_0.13991
Come on, let's hurry, Leon!
_0.13994
It looks like I'll be stuck on my butt for the rest of my life...
_0.13997
Say hello in the future! Lion.
_0.14000
Congratulations to Mina for being number one on the Galaxy Chart.
As expected, she's the diva who saved the galaxy.
_0.14003
That's because everyone helped me.
in addition…….
_0.14008
Because Leon was there...
Because you are special to me...
_0.14011
Um... Hey, Mina, are you sure it's okay?
_0.14014
Isn't that obvious?
_0.14017
But now Mina is the galaxy's leading diva.
_0.14020
That doesn't matter.
I want to be with Rion forever!
_0.14023
Besides... girls are greedy, aren't they?
I have to make all my dreams come true! Hey?
_0.14026
Mina...
Well then, let's make our dreams come true together from now on!
_0.14029
Yes!
I'm very happy now! Lion!
_0.14032
Se-no! !
_0.14034
“Macross 30 ~The singing voice that connects the galaxy~”
Thank you for playing until the end!
_0.14036
Congratulations on clearing!
I was impressed! !
_0.14038
If you can clear it,
I knew it from the beginning.
_0.14040
So, I cleared the game...
_0.14042
In fact, there are still many things we can do!
_0.14044
Yeah, that's right.
_0.14046
After this, you can save the clear data,
If you load that data, the play data will be inherited.
You can play the game from the beginning!
_0.14048
Wow, that's amazing.
So what data will be carried over?
_0.14050
Levels of all pilots and support characters,
The developed aircraft, the tune state of all aircraft, the money you have,
The items you own and your battle results will be carried over.
_0.14052
Ah, but...
Please note that some items may not be carried over.
_0.14054
Does that mean you can use a tuned aircraft from the beginning?
Our level is also high and we are invincible!
I can't do something like bullying the weak...
_0.14056
Fufufufu~.
For such people, the difficulty level is even harder than hard.
"Ultimate" has been released!
_0.14058
Ultimate...? Do you mean ultimate?
_0.14060
The difficulty level is worthy of the name Ultimate, so please look forward to it.
Since the difficulty level is high, if you play in Ultimate,
You'll receive a lot of good parts, money, and experience points from the beginning.
_0.14062
If you ask me that, Ultimate seems difficult,
It's a little scary to play...
_0.14064
Of course, you can also choose other than Ultimate,
Please don't worry.
_0.14066
Also, blueprints for development rank 3 are sold at the shop,
It became possible to develop Zentraedi-type aircraft,
You can become stronger than ever!
_0.14068
You can really do a lot of things.
_0.14070
That's sweet, Mina.
There are still clear benefits.
_0.14072
eh? Do you still have it?
_0.14074
In fact, from the second round, characters other than Leon also appeared.
You will be able to use it as your own player.
_0.14076
In other words, I and Mina can also use it.
Moreover, you can use all the characters from the beginning, so you can enjoy it right away.
_0.14078
Wow, that makes me happy.
I'll do my best too, so please use it!
_0.14080
And since you can freely board the aircraft,
Set up the characters and aircraft as you like.
_0.14082
Ah, but Basara can't change aircraft,
No one other than Basara can board the VF-19 Kai.
Please be careful.
_0.14084
Then, aircraft color 5 was released.
You can use a Havamar color aircraft.
_0.14086
Characters with variations in clothing
Now you can choose your clothes,
Choose the character with the clothes you like.
_0.14088
You can also choose my live costume, so
It's a little embarrassing, but please choose it.
_0.14090
Oh, now that I think about it, Aisha.
Unfortunately, there are people who didn't become friends on the first round,
You get to choose, right?
_0.14092
Oh, you know me very well, Mina.
_0.14094
It's so obvious.
For those who will be able to choose, well...
_0.14096
Mr. Leeron and Mr. Rod.
Mr. Ivanov, Mr. Nora, Mr. Kamzin and Mr. Sharon.
Also, Basara-san and Jeffrey-san.
_0.14098
Ah! And Mr. Ganes was there too!
_0.14100
Well, if you say so, I guess so...
I don't have to use Gunness though...
_0.14102
No matter how much I feel sorry for Mr. Gunness,
Aisha....
_0.14104
Well, I don't care about him,
There are still many elements to play with!
_0.14106
I agree!
Please continue to enjoy the second round!
_0.14108
What are you talking about, Mina?
Don't be so stingy about the second round.
3rd and 4th lap... Let's have them play for a long time!
_0.14110
Hehe, that's right.
See you again in the main story!
_0.14112
See you soon.
