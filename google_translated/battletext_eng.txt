_0.7
Rion Sakaki will appear.
_0.10
Aircraft all green, take off
_0.13
Okay, let's go then.
_0.16
It's sweet
_0.19
So are you serious?
_0.22
It's light
_0.25
It's done!
_0.28
Are you serious
_0.31
Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
_0.34
Damn it!
_0.37
Not yet!
_0.40
One more shot!
_0.43
Damn it!
_0.46
Chickshomega!
_0.49
Lick it...!
_0.52
Damn it!
_0.55
Chii!
_0.58
It's just rubbish
_0.61
I'm forgetful
_0.64
This one is a bonus
_0.67
Look!
_0.70
Well then, let's start
_0.73
Let's finish it quickly.
_0.76
I have to work for my salary.
_0.79
Don't think you can run away from me
_0.82
You're out of luck too.
_0.85
I'll clean it up quickly.
_0.88
Let's make it flashy!
_0.91
I'll let you decide!
_0.94
This one hurts!
_0.97
Stop here.
_0.100
If you want to step back, now's the time.
_0.103
Are you still going to do it?
_0.106
Too bad, this is also fate.
_0.109
It's like this, isn't it?
_0.112
It's a bit silly, I overdid it.
_0.115
I won't let you escape
_0.118
Sorry, but I'll let you drop it.
_0.121
I guess I should just drop him.
_0.124
Confirm the destruction of the attack target
_0.127
Wari is at work.
_0.130
That's a natural result.
_0.133
Make amends
_0.136
Has the shield gone crazy?
_0.139
Oh no, Aisha is getting mad at me.
_0.142
It will entertain you, won't it?
_0.145
This much is to be expected.
_0.148
It won't fall at this level
_0.151
Have you had too much fun?
_0.154
It's quite difficult to do, isn't it?
_0.157
I'm so disappointed in myself.
_0.160
You can do it...!
_0.163
Don't lick it!
_0.166
This guy is a bit silly and serious.
_0.169
I can't hang out in a place like this!
_0.172
I'm in a serious pinch.
_0.175
Still! still…!
_0.178
You're kidding, this is how it ended...
_0.181
I'm up to this point too...
_0.184
Mia...I'm coming to you too...
_0.187
Calm down a little
_0.190
It's going to get worse if this continues!
_0.193
Do you want to die? Stay back!
_0.196
That's a lie, can you believe this result?
_0.199
Don't be silly! I can't believe I'm getting hit...
_0.202
I couldn't protect myself again...
_0.205
That's nice timing.
_0.208
Now I can have fun too.
_0.211
I asked for backup.
_0.214
I won't accept such a fate!
_0.217
It's because I didn't have enough arms...
_0.220
Damn it! It's my mistake
_0.223
Mission complete, now I'm going home
_0.226
This is just a little bit of a choi.
_0.229
I'll do my job, I'm a professional after all.
_0.232
Running out of time is a funny joke.
_0.235
Oh my god, time is up...
_0.238
I must have been slow to make such a common mistake.
_0.241
Damn it! Mission failed, return home
_0.244
I thought I could do well...
_0.247
How should I report to Aisha that I failed?
_0.250
Shoot me as hard as you can
_0.253
I asked for cover fire.
_0.256
Keep your distance and support me
_0.259
Bring it to the fight with all your might.
_0.262
Hit me!
_0.265
Close your distance and support me.
_0.268
protect yourself by yourself
_0.271
Get down! Don't get too excited!
_0.274
Fighting isn't just about rushing in.
_0.277
Just be flashy!
_0.280
Give me one shot with a bang!
_0.283
Show me how serious you are
_0.286
Seriously, let’s go!
_0.289
Let's open with a bang!
_0.292
Come on over!
_0.295
roger that
_0.298
understood
_0.301
Hey hey
_0.304
Please be strong
_0.307
If you keep this up, you'll get killed.
_0.310
I'm too careless
_0.313
Is it possible for an ending like this to happen?
_0.316
Who did it!
_0.319
I was beaten! ? What are you doing!
_0.322
It's not bad, it's not a bad song...
_0.325
I can't fight in front of this song.
_0.328
This song...I'm sorry, but I'm leaving.
_0.331
That's a really good arm
_0.334
It's a skill that makes you fall in love with it.
_0.337
Sorry, I was helpful.
_0.340
I can't just stay asleep like this!
_0.343
The condition of the aircraft is not bad, as expected from Aisha.
_0.346
Let's kick off with a bang!
_0.349
Let the battle begin!
_0.352
Then, the battle begins!
_0.355
Let the battle begin!
_0.358
let's go!
_0.361
Let's do it!
_0.364
to go!
_0.367
Start the battle...
_0.370
Cool...
_0.373
cormorant…
_0.376
Good...
_0.379
Is there anything I can do?
_0.382
Please don't feel bad
_0.385
Warina...
_0.388
Don't die
_0.391
Thank you for the reinforcements
_0.394
Alright!
_0.397
This is an easy win
_0.400
It's like this
_0.403
please don't be reckless
_0.406
Please escape quickly
_0.409
Oh no, I'm retreating!
_0.412
Leave the battlefield!
_0.415
I'm leaving the battlefield!
_0.418
Are you okay?
_0.421
Leave the rest to me!
_0.424
OK?
_0.427
Do whatever you want!
_0.430
Leave my back to me
_0.433
As always, please
_0.436
Can I have you come over here?
_0.439
Stay strong and take action
_0.442
Can I have you come here?
_0.445
show me your power
_0.448
Here's your chance!
_0.451
It's now!
_0.454
I'll give you the good parts!
_0.457
Please make a bold decision!
_0.460
Let's fold!
_0.463
roger that!
_0.466
Understood!
_0.469
I got it!
_0.472
Oh no, I'm out of bullets.
_0.475
I'm out of bullets
_0.478
Did I shoot too many wasted bullets?
_0.481
No problems at all!
_0.484
Was it destroyed?
_0.487
I can't use this anymore
_0.490
Purge!
_0.493
It doesn't seem necessary this time
_0.496
I'm sorry, please lend me a hand.
_0.499
Can I ask for your help?
_0.502
request for rescue
_0.505
Let's intercept!
_0.508
Enemy aircraft confirmed! Let's intercept!
_0.511
Check out Vajra! Let's intercept!
_0.514
Check out Bandit! Let's intercept!
_0.517
Check out the guardian weapons! Let's intercept!
_0.520
Check out Havamar! Let's intercept!
_0.523
Check out Zentraedi! Let's intercept!
_0.526
Check enemy troops! Let's intercept!
_0.529
Check out the large flock of Vajra! Let's intercept!
_0.532
Check out the bandit squad! Let's intercept!
_0.535
Confirm many guardian weapons! Let's intercept!
_0.538
Check out many Havamar machines! Let's intercept!
_0.541
Many Zentraedi confirmed! Let's intercept!
_0.544
I also confirmed this! I'll support you!
_0.547
Enemy?
_0.550
Is it Vajra?
_0.553
Bandit?!
_0.556
A protective weapon?
_0.559
Is it Havamar?
_0.562
Zentraedi?
_0.565
I have to go help!
_0.568
I'll come to the rescue immediately!
_0.571
Damn it! Didn't you make it in time?
_0.574
Support failed! ? Damn it!
_0.577
But no matter how many times I see floating islands, I never get used to it.
_0.580
But this is a strange planet.
_0.583
There's sand everywhere you look. Ahhh
_0.586
It's a big and spacious place.
_0.589
Sammy. I miss the desert
_0.592
It really feels like a land of ice.
_0.595
Is there something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.598
Let's quickly move on to the next goal!
_0.601
There's something falling over there.
_0.604
Check the reaction of nearby items
_0.607
You're pretty far in. Is the remaining bullet okay?
_0.610
It seems like a dead end
_0.613
Let's get back to the ship!
_0.616
Now, let's go back to the ship!
_0.619
Sorry, that helped.
_0.622
Thank you
_0.625
thank you
_0.628
Isn't it amazing?
_0.631
Don't do it, I can't lose either.
_0.634
As expected!
_0.637
Let me go too.
_0.640
I'm going too!
_0.643
Now, all the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.646
It looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.649
There seems to be something around here
_0.652
That place looks suspicious
_0.655
Looks like there's something over there
_0.658
Aisha! Stay back!
_0.661
Mina! Stay back!
_0.664
rod! What are you doing!
_0.667
Aisha! Are you okay
_0.670
Mina! Are you okay
_0.673
rod! ...You idiot!
_0.676
As expected of you, Aisha!
_0.679
That’s amazing, Mina!
_0.682
I didn't praise it, but it's a great rod.
_0.685
I'm sure I kept it. It's time to leave it to me.
_0.688
Should I bring this with me? Understood
_0.691
Is it okay if I collect these guys? Understood
_0.694
Okay! Then I'll go and collect them.
_0.697
It seems like a formidable enemy. My arms are ringing!
_0.700
The opponent is a thief. I'm not going to moderate it.
_0.703
Don't you know where you are? Well, leave it to me!
_0.706
Is it okay to do such an easy job?
_0.709
Seems like a tedious job. Well, I'll do something
_0.712
Will you try it patiently?
_0.715
Please wait in peace
_0.718
Is it the Yuria Archipelago? Understood!
_0.721
Is it the Sierra Desert? Understood!
_0.724
Is it Madis Glacier? Understood!
_0.727
I guess I should take this to the guild.
_0.730
I should take this one with me.
_0.733
Target found!
_0.736
Hey, now you have your prize money!
_0.739
You're the bounty, I won't let you escape!
_0.742
Shame for you. Well then, I'll report it to the guild.
_0.745
I'll reflect in my cell.
_0.748
Well, let's go report to the guild.
_0.751
The conditions are now met. Should I go to the guild and report it?
_0.754
I delivered exactly what I was told.
_0.757
This is what was requested. I'll ask for confirmation.
_0.760
I won the bounty
_0.763
I would appreciate it if you could give me a reward.
_0.766
Alright, mission accomplished!
_0.769
It was quite a rewarding job!
_0.772
If anything happens again, leave it to me.
_0.775
What is this place?
_0.778
Vanquish Lace? Sounds interesting!
_0.781
Aisha Blanchett, I'm heading out.
_0.783
My maintenance was perfect today as well. I'll go then.
_0.785
Alright! Leave it to me!
_0.787
Good shot
_0.789
It's too late
_0.791
Are you serious about that?
_0.793
Here we go!
_0.795
What are you doing?
_0.797
He'll do it for you!
_0.799
Take it easy!
_0.801
Go ahead!
_0.803
This guy!
_0.805
It doesn't hurt!
_0.807
What are you going to do for me?
_0.809
What are you doing to the maiden?
_0.811
Hmm, already!
_0.813
Kuuuu!
_0.815
It's not dangerous!
_0.817
Yes, it's a bonus
_0.819
It's a present
_0.821
this is a service
_0.823
Let's start the mission
_0.825
Now, work, work
_0.827
I'm still confident in my arms
_0.829
I'm glued to you now
_0.831
Are you dissatisfied with me being your opponent?
_0.833
I won't let you escape, I'm sorry.
_0.835
Nothing is impossible for me!
_0.837
It's going to be spectacular!
_0.839
I'll make you feel a little hurt.
_0.841
I'll end it like this
_0.843
It's a natural progression, isn't it?
_0.845
There's definitely a chance
_0.847
fault? Was it a little too intense?
_0.849
Well, it's over already.
_0.851
It's such an easy win that I'm in trouble.
_0.853
That's the goal.
_0.855
I'm sorry, but I'll let you do it.
_0.857
I confirmed my goal.
_0.859
Sorry, this is also my job.
_0.861
I destroyed the target.
_0.863
As expected of me
_0.865
Will the shield be reduced due to expenses?
_0.867
Shields aren't free anymore.
_0.869
What can you do for me!
_0.871
Wow, repairs aren't free.
_0.873
Yay! I wonder if I should say...?
_0.875
Minor damage, no problem.
_0.877
Aren't you getting a little carried away?
_0.879
This talented and talented person is in a pinch!
_0.881
Cover this much damage with your arms!
_0.883
Kyaah! ...I didn't say that!
_0.885
Is this something you're in a pinch even if you don't have it?
_0.887
It's not going to be good if it stays like this.
_0.889
Aren't you naive enough to give up here?
_0.891
As expected...
_0.893
I won't give up! I can still do it!
_0.895
My dream... it ends here...
_0.897
It's a lie to say that you'll be beaten...
_0.899
Something like that...!
_0.901
Be strong now
_0.903
Do it right!
_0.905
It's dangerous if it stays like this
_0.907
Please give me a break now
_0.909
Sorry, I'm not strong enough.
_0.911
We have to somehow improve the war situation.
_0.913
Good timing! I just want to kiss you
_0.915
Looks like the war situation is changing for the better.
_0.917
I'll have you work hard!
_0.919
It's gone. What I did...!
_0.921
No luck...then I can't let it go.
_0.923
already! Don't let it happen to you
_0.925
No one can stop my inquisitive spirit!
_0.927
Ah~ I'm scared of my own talent and beauty! ...What?
_0.929
Sigh, being a branch manager isn't easy either.
_0.931
Being lax with your time is something you'd expect from a manager...
_0.933
I can't believe I made such an easy mistake...
_0.935
Running out of time is an impossible mistake.
_0.937
Failure! ? You must be kidding? You're joking, right! ?
_0.939
I thought you were a woman who could do more.
_0.941
Ah, I did it. I have to write a termination letter~
_0.943
Please shoot me hard
_0.945
Please support me with shooting.
_0.947
Focus on supporting fire
_0.949
Get close and engage in a melee battle!
_0.951
Please help me in the fight
_0.953
Totsugeki~!
_0.955
calm down a little
_0.957
focus on protecting yourself
_0.959
You're coming too far forward, step back a little.
_0.961
Show me how cool you are
_0.963
I have high hopes for you
_0.965
Just do it now!
_0.967
The price for making me angry will be high!
_0.969
I'll do it seriously!
_0.971
I can't control it from here!
_0.974
I got it
_0.976
Leave it to me
_0.978
I'm playing too much no matter what
_0.980
Hey, just do it properly!
_0.982
Please work seriously!
_0.984
What are you doing? Already!
_0.986
Stop joking. ...Hey, you're kidding! ?
_0.988
That...what's going on?!
_0.990
This is the power of singing...!
_0.992
That's amazing, I'll have to go back and research it soon!
_0.994
Deculture! It feels like
_0.996
Don't do it!
_0.998
I need to give you some kind of reward for this.
_0.1000
Thank you, that was helpful
_0.1002
Isn't it a kiss to wake up a princess?
_0.1004
The ruins are waiting for me! Let's go!
_0.1006
It's going to open with a bang!
_0.1008
Let the battle begin!
_0.1010
Let the battle begin!
_0.1013
I'll support you!
_0.1016
Leave the support to me!
_0.1019
Please leave the support to me
_0.1022
Now, let's do our best!
_0.1024
Come on, let's do our best
_0.1026
start!
_0.1028
Combat start…
_0.1031
Ugh...
_0.1034
Looks like I have no choice but to do it
_0.1036
Please don't feel bad
_0.1038
sorry
_0.1040
Don't get hurt
_0.1043
Alright, as expected of me!
_0.1045
I'm amazing!
_0.1047
This is an easy win
_0.1051
It's okay, I'll have to retreat!
_0.1053
I goofed! ? I'm leaving the battlefield!
_0.1056
Are you okay?
_0.1058
I'll take care of the rest
_0.1061
Do whatever you want
_0.1063
I'll leave your back to you! What?
_0.1065
Act at your own discretion
_0.1067
Please get together
_0.1069
Can I have you come over here?
_0.1071
Can I have you come over here?
_0.1073
Decide here!
_0.1075
Show me your power
_0.1078
Show me what's cool~
_0.1080
Do it in a flashy way!
_0.1082
Here's your chance!
_0.1085
I got it!
_0.1088
Hey, I'm out of bullets.
_0.1090
Too bad, I'm out of bullets.
_0.1092
I shot too many bullets.
_0.1094
No problem!
_0.1096
It was destroyed.
_0.1098
Now comes the real deal!
_0.1100
purge
_0.1102
It's a waste, but...
_0.1104
Can you lend me a hand?
_0.1106
Please help me
_0.1108
Help me
_0.1110
I'll intercept you!
_0.1112
Enemy aircraft confirmed! I'll intercept you!
_0.1114
Check out Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.1116
Check out Bandit! I'll intercept you!
_0.1118
Check out the guardian weapons! I'll intercept you!
_0.1120
Check out Havamar! I'll intercept you!
_0.1122
Check out Zentraedi! I'll intercept you!
_0.1124
Check enemy troops! I'll intercept you!
_0.1126
Check out the large flock of Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.1128
Check out the bandit squad! I'll intercept you!
_0.1130
Confirm many guardian weapons! I'll intercept you!
_0.1132
Check out many Havamar machines! I'll intercept you!
_0.1134
Many Zentraedi confirmed! I'll intercept you!
_0.1136
Check this out too! I'll support you!
_0.1138
It's the enemy!
_0.1140
Vajra!
_0.1142
Bandit!
_0.1144
A protective weapon!
_0.1146
Havamar!
_0.1148
Zentraedi!
_0.1152
I can't believe I didn't make it in time...
_0.1154
If only I could provide proper support...!
_0.1156
I want to investigate both that island and this island.
_0.1158
The wide sky and sea are the perfect situation for flying.
_0.1160
It's really hot. Should I wear some lighter clothes?
_0.1162
If this were the case, I would have taken proper UV care.
_0.1164
It's so cold...I feel like I'm freezing.
_0.1166
I'm sure there's some research hints here.
_0.1168
what happened? Are you okay?
_0.1170
Let's head to the next one quickly
_0.1172
There's something falling over there.
_0.1175
We're pretty far in. Is the remaining bullet okay?
_0.1177
It seems like a dead end
_0.1179
Now, let's go back to the ship.
_0.1181
Well then, let's go back to the ship.
_0.1183
thank you!
_0.1185
I was saved.
_0.1188
That's amazing!
_0.1190
Don't do it, keep it up and do your best
_0.1193
I'll let you go too.
_0.1195
I'm going too!
_0.1197
Now, the enemies around here have been annihilated.
_0.1199
It looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.1201
There seems to be something around here
_0.1203
That place looks suspicious
_0.1206

Please burn this place!
_0.2377
It's now!
_0.2380
Yes, I understand!
_0.2383
I ran out of bullets...
_0.2385
What should I do if I run out of bullets?
_0.2387
I shot too many bullets...
_0.2389
It's still okay!
_0.2391
It has been destroyed
_0.2393
This can't be used anymore
_0.2395
Purge!
_0.2397
This doesn't seem necessary
_0.2399
Excuse me, please lend me a hand!

_0.2449
I didn't make it in time
_0.2451
couldn't help
_0.2453
It's calm here
_0.2455
Calm sea, refreshing breeze, it feels good
_0.2457
The desert is huge! It's a wonderful view
_0.2459
It's hot. If I could go swimming in an oasis...
_0.2461
Ice is sparkling and beautiful!
_0.2463
It's cold... I'm starting to feel sleepy...
_0.2465
Is there something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.2467
Let's move on to the next goal!
_0.2469
Something is falling over there.
_0.2471
Checked the reaction of nearby items
_0.2473
You're pretty far in. Is the remaining bullet okay?
_0.2475
It seems like a dead end
_0.2477
Let's return to the ship
_0.2479
Now, let's go back to the ship.
_0.2481
sorry
_0.2483
It was helpful
_0.2486
It's amazing!
_0.2488
As expected, I have to do my best too!
_0.2491
Can I go too?
_0.2493
I want to go too!
_0.2495
Now you have wiped out all the enemies around here.
_0.2498
There seems to be something around here
_0.2500
It's suspicious over there
_0.2502
This area is suspicious
_0.2504
OK? Lion?
_0.2506
You're kidding too much, Aisha.
_0.2508
Mr. Alto, are you okay?
_0.2510
Rion is too reckless!
_0.2512
Are you alright! Aisha! ?
_0.2514
Please step back for a moment, Alto-san!
_0.2516
That's cool, Leon.
_0.2518
I will do my best to become like Aisha!
_0.2520
As expected of Alto
_0.2649
Furthermore, enemy reinforcements...maybe the enemy is serious this time!
_0.2651
Enemies will come one after another... Don't let your guard down!
_0.2708
The battle has begun, please be careful!
_0.2710

_0.2817
Do we have to fight like that...?
_0.2820
It seems we have no choice but to fight. It can't be helped, please start interception!
_0.2822
The attack target was destroyed...
_0.2826
It looks like the battle is over...but...
_0.2839
As expected! It was so cool!

_0.2853
Todo Ushio, sortie
_0.2855
It's sortie
_0.2857
sweet!
_0.2859
stupid
_0.2861
It's pointless
_0.2863
what! ?
_0.2865
He will do it...
_0.2867
It's not a bad attack.
_0.2869
Hmph!
_0.2871
Ha!
_0.2873
Yay!
_0.2875
…stupid!
_0.2877
Argh!
_0.2879
Sorry...!
_0.2881
nothing!
_0.2883
Hmm
_0.2885
ingredient!
_0.2887
Is that there?
_0.2889
Can't be dodged
_0.2891
Huh
_0.2893
It's the awakening of the true world!
_0.2895
Look at the rebuilding of the world!
_0.2897
The long nightmare will soon end
_0.2899
Watch it from the special seats!
_0.2901
As a reward, let me be your partner.
_0.2903
Do you think you can stop me?
_0.2905
Get to know this new power of mine!

_0.2919
Atonement for your foolishness!
_0.2921
Fuhahahahaha!
_0.2923
Please try to entertain me more!
_0.2925
Are you trying to defy me at that level?
_0.2927
Are you trying to block my path to supremacy?
_0.2929
Don't you want to change this distorted world?
_0.2931
Don't you want a world where Macross never fell? ?
_0.2933
Don't you want to change the past? ?
_0.2935
I want to eliminate all tragedies!
_0.2937
I won't let you get in the way of my dreams!
_0.2939
A world without Zentraedi! That's the world I want!
_0.2941
Earth's future enemy!
_0.2943
What's wrong with changing the world to its correct form?
_0.2945
Why don't you guys understand?
_0.2947
The future I wanted...
_0.2949
my dream...
_0.2951
The correct history of humanity...
_0.2953
continue the operation
_0.2955
It's not beautiful.
_0.2957
don't let me down
_0.2959
you are no longer needed
_0.2961
He's useless
_0.2963
It's unnecessary in my world
_0.2965
Will my dreams be crushed by a song?
_0.2967
Maybe even a song can change the world...
_0.2969
Hmm...that's really interesting...
_0.2971
well done
_0.2973
I'll praise you
_0.2975
The battle has begun!
_0.2977
Let the battle begin!
_0.2979
I am now comparable to God!
_0.2981
This is it! This power!
_0.2983
Did you see it! My power!
_0.2985
Retreat!
_0.2988
Rod Baltomer departs
_0.2990
Ready for sortie, take off
_0.2992
I need to go, let's go.
_0.2994
That's sweet
_0.2996
slow!
_0.2998
Are you kidding?
_0.3000
what!
_0.3002
this is!
_0.3004
He'll do it!
_0.3007
Is the end!
_0.3009
It's this one!
_0.3011
Oops!
_0.3013
Damn it!
_0.3015
Cheeky!
_0.3017
Did you faint?
_0.3019
If it's right
_0.3022
There's more!
_0.3024
I can't dodge it!
_0.3026
I'll kill this guy!
_0.3028
Start the operation now
_0.3030
Accomplish your mission, be sure
_0.3032
It's easy for me to do this much.
_0.3034
Acquire target
_0.3036
Let me be your opponent
_0.3038
I won't let you escape!
_0.3040
For the world I want!
_0.3042
Disappear from this world!
_0.3044
Become Chile!
_0.3046
Don't you understand the difference in ability?
_0.3048
Any more is useless
_0.3050
Do you think you can beat me?
_0.3052
shoot down the enemy
_0.3054
I can't be your opponent
_0.3056
Zako is
_0.3058
prepare to intercept
_0.3060
let me drop it
_0.3062
Capture and destroy the target
_0.3064
destroy the target
_0.3066
Have you cleaned up?
_0.3068
Because you get in my way
_0.3070
Has the shield been destroyed?
_0.3072
I'll give you at least a shield.
_0.3074
The shield just broke.
_0.3076
This much is within expectations.
_0.3078
Minor damage, continue operation
_0.3080
If this is the case
_0.3082
There is no problem in carrying out the operation.
_0.3084
What, what's going on?
_0.3086
entertains
_0.3088
Still! At this level!
_0.3090
Looks like my understanding was naive.
_0.3092
It will keep you on track!
_0.3094
I can't let it happen here!
_0.3096
Why! Why am I...!
_0.3098
stupid! I’m like this…!
_0.3100
Mia...I'm for you...!
_0.3102
Without being able to accomplish anything...I...!
_0.3104
Where did I go the wrong way...?
_0.3106
Stay back!
_0.3108
You're in my way, get down.
_0.3110
support
_0.3112
It's because I'm overconfident
_0.3114
Leave the battlefield
_0.3116
I couldn't protect you again...
_0.3118
Confirmed reinforcements
_0.3120
Looks like reinforcements
_0.3122
This gave them an advantage
_0.3124
The defense target has been destroyed!
_0.3126
What a blunder while I was there...
_0.3128
Damn it! It's my mistake
_0.3130
The mission is complete, now I'm heading back to the ship.
_0.3132
It's a natural result, it's natural.
_0.3134
Just eliminate anything that gets in your way.
_0.3136
Time is up! ?
_0.3138
I made such a boring mistake...!
_0.3140
Exceeds mission execution time, retreats
_0.3142
The operation has failed, we are retreating.
_0.3144
Always recover from failure! Definitely!
_0.3146
They say I don't have time to stop...!
_0.3148
Give cover fire
_0.3150
Move on to shooting!
_0.3152
Support with fire from the rear
_0.3154
Attract your opponent in close combat
_0.3156
Bring it on to the fighting!
_0.3158
Move to close combat
_0.3160
think only about survival
_0.3162
Defend and don't miss the chance to counterattack
_0.3164
Strengthen your defenses
_0.3166
The enemy is showing an opening, now!
_0.3168
Start an all-out attack!
_0.3170
Let's be of some help
_0.3172
Looks like you got me serious
_0.3174
I'll show you the obvious difference in power!
_0.3176
I grasp the future with Mia!
_0.3179
Understood
_0.3181
Ha!
_0.3183
I'll be there to support you
_0.3185
I can't do it alone
_0.3187
You're sticking out too much, get down.
_0.3189
stupid…
_0.3191
It's because you're overconfident in your own power.
_0.3193
I never expected something like this to happen
_0.3195
A song...not bad
_0.3197
I haven't been singing since those days...
_0.3199
Are you saying this is the power of singing?
_0.3201
It's okay
_0.3203
That's natural
_0.3205
I'm saved, I'll get back to work.
_0.3207
There's no way I can stop here...!
_0.3213
Combat start!
_0.3220
let's go
_0.3222
come out
_0.3229
If you become an enemy...
_0.3231
Are you still going to do it?
_0.3233
sorry
_0.3237
That's weak
_0.3239
Okay!
_0.3241
It's not worth stopping
_0.3243
please don't be reckless
_0.3250
Retreat quickly!
_0.3253
Fight as you like
_0.3255
I'll leave my back to you
_0.3258
Gather together
_0.3261
Is it okay if I come here?
_0.3263
Show me your power
_0.3265
Don't miss the opportunity!
_0.3267
let's end the fight
_0.3269
It's an all-out attack!
_0.3271
Do it now!
_0.3273
Let's end this
_0.3277
I got it
_0.3279
I'm out of bullets! ?
_0.3281
Are you out of bullets?
_0.3283
Did I fire too many wasted bullets?
_0.3285
This much!
_0.3287
I can't use this anymore
_0.3289
dispose of equipment
_0.3291
purge
_0.3293
unnecessary
_0.3295
I'm sorry, but please lend me a hand.
_0.3297

_0.3326
I also confirmed this! I will support you!
_0.3334
I need to be rescued.
_0.3337
Didn't you make it in time?
_0.3339
Oh my god! The support failed! ?
_0.3341
I wanted to see this view with Mia.
_0.3343
Flying over the sea makes you forget everything
_0.3345
I'm used to the desert
_0.3347
I want to walk on my own sometimes
_0.3349
This place looks cold and sad
_0.3351
The galaxy is full of tragedy...
_0.3353
Is something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.3355
Let's quickly move on to the next goal!
_0.3357
something is falling over there
_0.3361
It seems like a dead end.
_0.3363
Now, let's return to the ship.
_0.3365
Let's go back to the ship
_0.3367
appreciate
_0.3369
Was saved
_0.3372
Just as expected!
_0.3374
You should be able to aim for even higher heights.
_0.3377
I'll let you go too.
_0.3379
I'm going too!
_0.3381
I've now destroyed all the enemies around here.
_0.3384
There seems to be something around here
_0.3386
That place looks suspicious
_0.3388
This area is suspicious
_0.3390
in the way! Lion!
_0.3392
Mina! What are you doing!
_0.3394
Aisha! What are you doing!
_0.3396
Lion! You idiot!
_0.3398
Mina! Stay back!
_0.3400
Aisha! Stay back!
_0.3402
Not bad, Leon.
_0.3404
Let's do it, Mina

_0.3710
Alya, I'm out of ammo.
_0.3712
Desne is out of bullets
_0.3714
I fired too many bullets needlessly.
_0.3716
It's broken.
_0.3718
It's a waste
_0.3720
Make amends!

Dakara where the sky and sea shine
_0.3782
I like big trees.
_0.3784
Dakara full of sand
_0.3786
I like oasis Desne
_0.3788
The shine of the ice is beautiful

That’s sweet, Korra!
_0.3860
Get serious, Korra!
_0.3862
light light light
_0.3864
What is it?
_0.3866
Higya
_0.3868
Gufu
_0.3870
Damn it! Collar!
_0.3872
Oh, oh, oh!
_0.3874
One more shot, Korra!
_0.3876
Hegya
_0.3878
Chicksho Collar
_0.3880
Don't lick it!
_0.3882
Wow
_0.3884
Hello
_0.3886
Guwa
_0.3888
Hey there!
_0.3890
More!
_0.3892
Not yet, Koller!
_0.3894
Are you scared of me?
_0.3896
You guys, take it!
_0.3898
Now I can unite the bandits!
_0.3900
Come on! Collar!
_0.3902
Come on, caller!
_0.3904
Hey, come on!
_0.3906
Oraoraoraoraoraoraora!
_0.3908
I'm the man who will become Bandit King!
_0.3910
I'll show you my power!
_0.3912
Is it okay if I miss it?
_0.3914
Come to me quietly!
_0.3917
Did you see my power?
_0.3919
Go away, Korra!
_0.3921
You'll regret it!
_0.3923
Don't let me escape!
_0.3925
Destroy the target, Koller!
_0.3927
You guys, destroy that thing!
_0.3929
Let's do it! The goal is broken!
_0.3931
You destroyed it, Koller!
_0.3933
Destroy the attack target, Koller!
_0.3936
Shields are a nuisance, Koller!
_0.3938
A man can take it with his bare hands!
_0.3940
Okay, I understand! Collar!
_0.3942
If you can do it, try it!
_0.3944
Don't listen, Korra!
_0.3946
This is it, Korra!
_0.3948
That's quite a feat!
_0.3950
Hey, what are you doing?
_0.3952
You can do it, Korra!
_0.3954
Don't lick it! Collar!
_0.3956
What the hell is this guy?
_0.3958
I never heard that it was this strong!
_0.3960
Shit, shit, what an arm...
_0.3962
Hey, you got carried away...!
_0.3964
Higyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
_0.3966
Fugyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
_0.3968
Hegyaaaaaaaaaaaaa
_0.3970
Don't get muddy, Korra!
_0.3972
You're just getting in the way!
_0.3974
Let's rush into the enemy!
_0.3976
I'll be in danger!
_0.3978
Don't be silly! I can't believe I'm being beaten!
_0.3980
Damn it, Korra!
_0.3982
Reinforcements, Korra!
_0.3985
I won't give you the credit!
_0.3987
I was careless and it was destroyed
_0.3989
I guess I'll get yelled at again!
_0.3991
Damn it, I did it!
_0.3993
The day when I become Bandit King is coming soon!
_0.3995
I will control all bandits!
_0.3997
Oh, oh, oh, Korra!
_0.3999
What if I run out of time and fail?
_0.4001
It's unethical to worry about time.
_0.4003
When time is up, caller!
_0.4005
I will surrender myself, so please forgive me for my life!
_0.4007
Big brother! Suiyasen!
_0.4009
I'm sure it's a failure or I'll get scolded again!
_0.4011
Shoot, shoot, shoot!
_0.4013
Shoot, Koller!
_0.4015
You can hit a few shots.
_0.4017
Don't try to hit me physically!
_0.4019
Hit me! Collar!
_0.4021
Show me your special fighting attacks.
_0.4023
Protect yourself by yourself
_0.4025
Repel the enemy's attacks!
_0.4027
Be on your guard, Korra!
_0.4029
Kamashichimae! Collar!
_0.4031
Do whatever you like!
_0.4033
Give it your all!
_0.4036
Hmm!
_0.4038
Take it!
_0.4040
Understood, Koller!
_0.4042
Got it, Korra!
_0.4044
Understood, brother!
_0.4046
Are you okay, brother?
_0.4048
Please show me your usual strength, brother!
_0.4050
Big brother! Please be strong
_0.4052
Big brother!
_0.4054
Chikishooh, remember it!
_0.4056
If my brother is defeated, I won't be able to do it...
_0.4059
I can't fight in front of this song.
_0.4062
That's a really good arm, brother!
_0.4064
Your skill is mesmerizing, brother!
_0.4066
Are you okay? I'll help you now.
_0.4068
Please don't disturb me.
_0.4070
The battle has begun! Collar!
_0.4073
Let's start the battle!
_0.4075
let's go!
_0.4077
Do!
_0.4084
Anyone can do it!
_0.4086
Are you still going to do it?
_0.4088
You idiot!
_0.4090
I don't care what happens!
_0.4092
Thank you for the reinforcements
_0.4094
Okay!
_0.4096
Easy win!
_0.4098
Zako!
_0.4100
Don't be reckless!
_0.4102
Please escape quickly!
_0.4104
Let's retreat!
_0.4106
We're leaving the battlefield!
_0.4108
We're leaving the battlefield!
_0.4111
Leave the rest to me!
_0.4113
OK? !
_0.4115
Do it like you're doing it!
_0.4117
You can do whatever you like!
_0.4119
I'll let you do this as well.
_0.4121
Gather together! Collar!
_0.4123
Gather near me!
_0.4125
Is it okay if we get together?
_0.4127
Just do it!
_0.4129
Don't miss this chance!
_0.4131
It's now!
_0.4133
Yay, Korra!
_0.4135
Show me your full power!
_0.4137
Please do it!
_0.4139
Sure
_0.4141
I get it
_0.4143
Understood!
_0.4145
You're out of bullets, Korra!
_0.4147
I'm out of bullets! ?
_0.4149
I shot too many wasted bullets.
_0.4151
It was destroyed!
_0.4153
Not yet! Collar!
_0.4155
No problem!
_0.4157
purge!
_0.4159
It's from here! Collar!

_0.4212

_0.4214
It's close to my family's territory.
_0.4216
I have a lot of memories here
_0.4218
Blow away the heat! Collar!
_0.4220
Let's build muscle strength by running on the sand!
_0.4222
Bandit King! What a mesmerizing sound!
_0.4224
I'll add this area to my territory.
_0.4226
Hey, is something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.4229
There's something falling over there!
_0.4231
Found a treasure nearby!
_0.4234
It seems like a dead end.
_0.4236
Let's return to the ship!

_0.4347
What do you think?
_0.4349
No problems at all!
_0.4351
not yet!
_0.4353
Minor damage!
_0.4355
I need to calm down
_0.4357
That's dangerous
_0.4360
Damn, I can still go.
_0.4362
I can't stand being beaten!
_0.4365
this is…
_0.4367
Like that...
_0.4369
Stupid!
_0.4371
Ugh...that's it...

They got me! Oh my god
_0.4398
It was destroyed...
_0.4400
To fail...
_0.4402
Maybe I got too carried away...
_0.4404
Mission failed... I'm retreating...
_0.4406
What is this song...
_0.4408
I don't feel like fighting...
_0.4410
I heard a great song
_0.4413
This is yet to come!
_0.4423
Next!
_0.4426
Did you do it?

That's amazing!
_0.4452
Don't do it!
_0.4455

_0.4458
You have great courage to come and challenge my unit!
_0.4461
If you get closer than that, a warning won't be enough!
_0.4464
Anything that approaches will be shot down without any questions asked!
_0.4467
Damn! That's all... Retreat!
_0.4470
You're quite good, so be prepared next time we meet!
_0.4473
There's nothing I can do about it, I'll retreat for now.
_0.4476
You did it! I have no choice but to retreat from here...
_0.4479
Against such a bastard...!
_0.4482
My friends won't stay silent any longer!
_0.4485
Shit, can't you escape?
_0.4488
Thank you for the rescue!

No problem.
_0.4560
Not yet
_0.4562
It doesn't even hurt this much
_0.4564
This is so bad
_0.4566
It's a little scary
_0.4568
Let's do it
_0.4570
I can still go!
_0.4572
How are you doing?
_0.4575
I did a bad job...
_0.4577
Can you admit this?
_0.4579
Chikkisho!
_0.4581
Hey, help me!
_0.4583
Wow!
_0.4585
That's so~

He's useless, isn't he?
_0.4599
Reinforcements! ? I was saved.
_0.4601
Thank you for coming!
_0.4603
Okay! Let's counterattack from here
_0.4605
The crystals of my blood, sweat, and tears that I bought with a 35-year loan!
_0.4607
Hideko did it!
_0.4609
It was destroyed! ?
_0.4611
It's a failure, damn it
_0.4613
Is it impossible for me...
_0.4615
Did you fail? Just kidding!
_0.4617
This song... reminds me of my hometown in the countryside...
_0.4619
Why are you fighting...me?
_0.4621
This feeling... Should I withdraw?
_0.4624
It's not over yet!
_0.4633
Thank you for the reinforcements.
_0.4635
It's an easy win!
_0.4638
I did it!
_0.4649
I'm out of bullets!
_0.4651
I shot too many bullets needlessly.
_0.4655
It's still okay!
_0.4657
Sorry
_0.4660
Thank you very much
_0.4662
Awesome!
_0.4665
As expected!
_0.4667
It takes a lot of courage for him to come into my territory! Get ready!
_0.4669
Temeera! Whose territory do you think this is?
_0.4671
You have the nerve to pick a fight with us! Don't slack off!
_0.4673
You must be unlucky to fly to a place like this.
_0.4675
Damn it, I can't stand it at all! Retreat! Retreat!
_0.4677
I'll forgive you for this time! Remember!
_0.4679
Next time I won't cut back, so be prepared!
_0.4681
Hey, please forgive me.
_0.4683

_0.4686
That Valkyrie looks like it will sell for a high price! Wait!
_0.4689
What's up, try flying faster.
_0.4692
Let's go!
_0.4694
I'm ready, let's go!
_0.4696
I will deal with it myself!
_0.4698

Charge with determination!

_0.4797
Well, I can't use it.
_0.4799
Who is this guy?
_0.4801
We don't need weak people!
_0.4803
Reinforcements! ? A poor imitation
_0.4805
I don't need reinforcements
_0.4807
I'll do it for you, so stand back!
_0.4809
Damn, you did it!
_0.4811
What are you doing!
_0.4813
I caught a chance! ?
_0.4815
I failed!
_0.4817
They have bones!
_0.4819
Mission failed! ? Retreat!
_0.4821
This song... somewhere?
_0.4823
I'll sing too!
_0.4825
Songs are culture!
_0.4827
Hey, were you able to help me?
_0.4829
If things continue like this, I won't be able to hold back.
_0.4838
Thank you for the reinforcements.

Hey, are you okay?
_0.4857
I'm out of bullets!
_0.4859
Oh no, I'm out of bullets.
_0.4861
I shot too many wasted bullets.
_0.4863
You did it
_0.4865
Was it destroyed?
_0.4867
This is going to be expensive.
_0.4875
Brothers over there, just leave your money and disappear!
_0.4877
What are you guys? Whose territory do you think this is?
_0.4879
Dudes! Kick them off!
_0.4881
Fuck you bastards! Kakare!
_0.4883
These guys are pretty good at it! Bastards retreat!
_0.4885
That's all I'll do for now! Remember!
_0.4888
I can't help it, I'll give you this!
_0.4890
Hey! Don't run away!
_0.4892
That Valkyrie looks expensive!
_0.4894
If you don't fly faster, we'll catch up to you, right?
_0.4896
Welcome! This is a Valkyrie maintenance shop!
_0.4899
Is that work okay?
_0.4902
There is a guide!

The maintenance was perfect!
_0.4908
Please come again!

Damn it! Are you a hunter?
_0.4920
Yay, I found it!
_0.4923
Hunter... I'll take revenge on you!
_0.4926
How can I be defeated by a hunter?
_0.4929
Is it a hunter? I'll do it!
_0.4932
Don't miss it!

_0.7671
what up! come on!
_0.7673
Hey, please be serious.
_0.7675
Are you okay?
_0.7677
Hey! Escape!
_0.7679
What are you doing!
_0.7681
You clumsy!
_0.7683
Reinforcements!
_0.7685
Let me rely on you a little bit.
_0.7687
I guess it's a little late coming
_0.7690
Was the target destroyed? ?
_0.7692
I... can't I protect anything?
_0.7694
It seems like it was a success, and I survived again.
_0.7696
Operation complete, return home.
_0.7698
With a strategy like this, it was an easy victory.
_0.7700
I've done it, my time is up...
_0.7702
Such a mistake...I wonder what Captain Fokker will say...
_0.7704
Time is up...I feel like an idiot...
_0.7706
I didn't become a pilot just to roam around!
_0.7708
Even if I close my eyes, this reality won't change...
_0.7710
Could it be because of the cursed Kadun that it failed? ?
_0.7712
I'll leave the supporting fire to you.
_0.7714
Give me solid rear support.
_0.7716
Concentrate on shooting
_0.7718
Come forward and fight!
_0.7720
I asked for close combat!
_0.7722
Bring it into close combat!
_0.7724
It's dangerous if you leave it like that!
_0.7726
You stay back!
_0.7728
Protect yourself by yourself
_0.7730
Do it! Now's your chance!
_0.7732
Don't miss this opportunity!
_0.7734
I'll leave this scene to you!
_0.7736
Can you survive being beaten?
_0.7738
Not yet! From now on!
_0.7740
This is it!
_0.7742
got it
_0.7746
Captain, please be more careful than worrying about me.
_0.7748
What are you doing, Captain?
_0.7750
Is that okay, Captain?
_0.7752
Captain!
_0.7754
Are you kidding? The captain got killed.
_0.7756
Well done Captain!
_0.7758
This is the power of song...
_0.7760
It's like hearing a forest song...it feels so good...
_0.7762
I can't fight anymore...
_0.7764
What skill!
_0.7775
Okay, let's do it!
_0.7777
I'll do it!
_0.7783
Tsu…
_0.7785
Is there no choice but to do it?
_0.7789
Don't die!
_0.7792
Alright, we did it!
_0.7794
I did well
_0.7805
Fight as you like
_0.7807
I left my back to you
_0.7809
Please fight as you like too.
_0.7811
Please gather together
_0.7813
Stay strong and take action!
_0.7815
Could you please come here?
_0.7817
Show me your power!
_0.7819
Now's your chance!
_0.7822
Give me one shot!
_0.7824
now or never!
_0.7826
Please do your best here!
_0.7831
I'm out of bullets!
_0.7834
Did I shoot too much?
_0.7836
Destroyed!
_0.7838
What! ?
_0.7842
From here!
_0.7844
lend me a hand
_0.7846
ask for help
_0.7848
Please help!
_0.7854
Check out the guardian weapons! I will intercept you!
_0.7861
Confirm many guardian weapons! I will intercept you!
_0.7872
Go to the rescue!
_0.7875
Damn it! Didn't you make it in time?
_0.7877
Isn't it like that... I can't protect it...
_0.7879
It's strange that the island is floating.
_0.7881
Is this reality?
_0.7883
Even in the middle of the desert, people can survive.
_0.7885
It's hot, it feels like it's on fire
_0.7887
It's cold, there's only ice
_0.7889
Will the earth here also shake?
_0.7891
What's the matter, is something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.7893
Are you rushing to your next goal?
_0.7895
There's something falling over there.
_0.7897
Checked item response
_0.7901
Return to the ship
_0.7903
Alright, let's go back to the ship!
_0.7908
That's quite a skill.
_0.7910
well done
_0.7913
I'll let you go too!
_0.7916
Looks like all the enemies in this area have been wiped out.
_0.7918
Looks like you've wiped out all the enemies in this area.
_0.7922
There seems to be something around here
_0.7924
What are you doing, Leon?
_0.7926
Lion! Leave this to me!
_0.7928
Let's do it, Leon.
_0.7930
As someone who guides the wind, why am I doing something like this?
_0.7932
The disaster has come so far...
_0.7934
The wind blows, a terrible wind carrying the destructive Kadun...
_0.7936
God of the wind, please protect that person.
_0.7938
It's my job to protect you from Kadun.
_0.7940
I can't let the song of destruction echo throughout the world!
_0.7942
To think I would have to rely on the power of Iron Kadun...
_0.7944
Release your power now!
_0.7946
You should be able to overcome the cursed Kadun.
_0.7948
It's cursed by Kadun, the bringer of destruction.
_0.7950
Ah...the iron Kadun...
_0.7952
It's because I relied on Kadun of iron and Kadun of fire.
_0.7954
Noaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
_0.7956
Again...life...
_0.7958
That...what the hell!
_0.7960
This is also guided by the wind.
_0.7962
No way...a bird person!
_0.7964
I can't believe he's coming to get himself involved in a fight...
_0.7966
I just fulfilled my duty as a guide of the wind.
_0.7968
It looks like we have been able to overcome the calamity of Kadun...
_0.7970
The rustling wind has calmed down, and the wind of destruction seems to have passed...
_0.7972
A song of sacred pilgrimage to you...
_0.7974
May the wind blow for you
_0.7976
Give power to that person...
_0.7978
yes
_0.7981
Follow the guidance of the wind
_0.7983
If I continue like this, I will be possessed by the cursed Kadun!
_0.7985
According to the wind...it's dangerous.
_0.7987
Looks like Kadun was possessed.
_0.7989
The wind of destruction!
_0.7991
It seems like he couldn't defeat Kadun the Calamity after all.
_0.7993
This is the bloody end of Ikusabito...
_0.7995
you're always fighting
_0.7997
Are you...a bird person?
_0.7999
A song of destruction...
_0.8001
God of the wind. Please protect me
_0.8003
The wind is blowing…. Carrying Kadun who brings destruction
_0.8005
It's my role to protect you from Kadun.
_0.8007
A rustling wind is blocking the sacred tour
_0.8009
The tune of the wind is singing
_0.8011
Follow the guidance
_0.8013
The song of destruction resounds throughout the world...
_0.8015
God of the wind!
_0.8018
The wind of destruction blows!
_0.8020
Kadun!
_0.8022
Bird person...?
_0.8024
You who do not know the horror of the impurity of blood!
_0.8026
It invites great disaster!
_0.8028
Shall I give you a cursed Kadun?
_0.8030
Are you trying to steal our souls?
_0.8032
Let's go help!
_0.8034
You need to get help right away!
_0.8036
Ahh! I didn't make it in time...
_0.8038
Oh my god!
_0.8040
The Mayan people can survive as long as they have forests and the sea.
_0.8042
Kadun is nesting behind the grass.
_0.8044
I feel the Kadun of disaster beneath the earth...
_0.8046
The wind is blocking the sacred tour
_0.8048
I feel the great power of Kadun...
_0.8050
Building a city on ice...
_0.8052
What happened?
_0.8054
Let's follow the guidance
_0.8056
something is falling over there
_0.8058
I feel that there is something nearby
_0.8060
You've come a long way
_0.8062
Seems like a dead end
_0.8069
The sacred cycle has become stronger
_0.8071
You may be more than a bird person.
_0.8073
The sacred cycle has been strengthened
_0.8075
let's go with you
_0.8077
May I go with you?
_0.8079
This will keep the great disasters away from here.
_0.8081
This will calm down the angry Kadun around here.
_0.8084
I feel something from there
_0.8086
Looks like there's something over there
_0.8088
Lion! should not!
_0.8090
Shin! should not!
_0.8092
Lion!
_0.8094
Shin! Shin!
_0.8096
Good for you, Leon.
_0.8098
Good for you, Shin.
_0.8100
Well, let's go!
_0.8102
I'll help you
_0.8104
The wind... you look like a big sister.
_0.8106
Because I believe in you.
_0.8108
Kadun is coming...!
_0.8111
Wow, you look like a bird person
_0.8113
Fly away!
_0.8115
Show me how cool you are a little bit
_0.8117
Hey, stay strong
_0.8119
At this rate, I'll be defeated!
_0.8121
already! What are you doing?
_0.8123
Noaaaaaaaaaaaa!
_0.8125
No way!
_0.8127
A cup of Kadun...
_0.8129
Did you come to help me?
_0.8131
I'm relieved now
_0.8133
Great, my friend came.
_0.8135
Hehe, that's amazing!
_0.8137
Did I help you a little?
_0.8139
It was successful, right? That was good~
_0.8141
See you!
_0.8143
I'll protect you from Kadun.
_0.8146
Yes
_0.8148
Yes yes
_0.8150
I'll try it
_0.8152
It's dangerous if it stays like this
_0.8154
I'm possessed by Kadun...
_0.8156
Stay strong! If it stays like this...
_0.8158
The song of destruction...
_0.8160
Something like that...
_0.8162
It's because of Kadun the Calamity.
_0.8164
great!
_0.8167
I will support you!
_0.8169
I'll do my best to help you!
_0.8171
I'll do my best too!
_0.8173
I'll do my best!
_0.8175
I won't lose!
_0.8177
Let's go!
_0.8180
Please take a rest
_0.8182
Are you okay?
_0.8184
Check this too! I'll support you!
_0.8186
It's the enemy!
_0.8188
It's Vajra!
_0.8190
It's Bandit!
_0.8192
It's a protective weapon!
_0.8194
It's Havamar!
_0.8196
It's Zentraedi!
_0.8199
We need to go to the rescue immediately!
_0.8201
Ahh! be not in time
_0.8203
I failed to assist you...
_0.8205
It might look a bit like the Mayan Sea.
_0.8207
Wow, the island is floating!
_0.8209
It's hot. I want to swim in the sea.
_0.8211
It's a spectacular place with sand everywhere.
_0.8213
It's cold! If you go into the sea like this, you'll get stiff.
_0.8215
Is this huge lump made entirely of ice?
_0.8217
Is there something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.8219
Let's quickly move on to the next goal!
_0.8221
There's something falling over there.
_0.8223
There's something nearby
_0.8225
You've come a long way, aren't you tired?
_0.8227
It seems like a dead end
_0.8229
Return to the ship.
_0.8231
Well, let's go back to the ship!
_0.8234
That saved me~
_0.8237
amazing!
_0.8239
I'll do it~
_0.8242
I’m going too!
_0.8244
I'm going too!
_0.8246
Now, the evil spirit Kadun around here is gone.
_0.8248
Now, the evil spirit Kadun around here is gone.
_0.8250
I feel like there's something going on around here.
_0.8252
It's weird over there
_0.8254
Looks like there's something over there
_0.8257
Shin! Are you okay?
_0.8260
Shin!
_0.8262
As expected, Rion!
_0.8264
As expected of Shin!
_0.8266
Sounds good, let's go!
_0.8268
It's Nora, I'm leaving.
_0.8270
Not a bad setup, let's go!
_0.8272
So sweet!
_0.8275
It's a waste!
_0.8277
Grrrr
_0.8279
You!
_0.8281
What did you say!
_0.8283
Damn it!
_0.8285
received!
_0.8287
end it
_0.8289
What!
_0.8291
Nuuuu
_0.8293
Will do it
_0.8295
This guy!
_0.8297
Tsk
_0.8300
Isn't there a lot of gaps?
_0.8302
There you go!
_0.8304
I won't spoil it
_0.8306
It is difficult to make a strategy of this level fail.
_0.8308
Please entertain me a little
_0.8310
Now it's time for some fun hunting.
_0.8312
Look, it's this way.
_0.8314
Run away! Run away!
_0.8316
I'll play with you
_0.8318
Die
_0.8320
I'll take care of this guy!
_0.8322
Dance! Dance! Let's dance!
_0.8324
You stubborn guy
_0.8326
Don't come to death
_0.8328
How does it feel to have your life in your hands?
_0.8330
We're not the enemy.
_0.8332
Insects!
_0.8334
Who said it was okay to fall?
_0.8336
I'll handle that one!
_0.8338
I found my goal...
_0.8340
Is that your prey? Make me happy.
_0.8342
Isn't there a better prey?
_0.8344
boring
_0.8346
We destroyed the target.
_0.8348
A shield won't give you peace of mind
_0.8350
Did the shield go crazy?
_0.8352
I think the shield is fine!
_0.8354
That level makes me laugh
_0.8356
The damage is minor.
_0.8358
Isn't it interesting!
_0.8360
Don't get carried away
_0.8362
I won't let you down at that level.
_0.8364
That's a pretty good arm, isn't it?
_0.8366
Lick me!
_0.8368
Don't get in my way!
_0.8370
Now comes the real deal.
_0.8372
To be able to do this...
_0.8374
Do it to moss!
_0.8376
How can you entertain me this much!
_0.8378
Such an idiot
_0.8380
The aircraft was damaged, I'm looking for a rendezvous!
_0.8382
If I...was knocked down...
_0.8384
Take control of your own life!
_0.8386
Gus! Do you want to die?
_0.8388
Are you also suicidal?
_0.8390
This useless thing!
_0.8392
Because you underestimate the battlefield!
_0.8394
I'm weak!
_0.8396
Reinforcements? I'll leave that to you.
_0.8398
Don't take away my fun
_0.8400
This is enough for me alone
_0.8402
Couldn't you protect it?
_0.8404
You'll do a great job, right?
_0.8406
Another wasted life wasted...
_0.8408
I thought it would be a little more fun.
_0.8410
There's no way I can fail
_0.8412
Mission completed, return immediately
_0.8414
Is this the end of the fun time...
_0.8416
I never expected it to end like this...
_0.8418
If you run out of time...you're an idiot!
_0.8420
It was me who failed! ?
_0.8422
Tch, that's all, I'm retreating.
_0.8424
Damn it! I will definitely repay this debt!
_0.8426
Keep your distance and provide support
_0.8428
Move to supporting fire!
_0.8430
I'll come forward, support you.
_0.8432
Don't rush in without permission
_0.8434
You're the one doing the close combat!
_0.8436
Do you have the skills to be a decoy?
_0.8438
in the way
_0.8440
Get back down
_0.8442
Run away while you're still alive
_0.8444
Thorough pest control
_0.8446
Don't do it
_0.8448
Go wild as you like
_0.8450
Looks like you need some punishment
_0.8452
please entertain me more
_0.8454
That's all for fun
_0.8457
The guy who orders a lot
_0.8459
understood
_0.8461
He's a useless captain.
_0.8463
It's your choice to fall, but don't drag me into it.
_0.8465
That's not enough to make you a captain.
_0.8467
He's a captain in name only.
_0.8469
Did the captain fall?
_0.8471
Is he a strong enough opponent to defeat the captain? Looks like it'll be fun.
_0.8473
What is this feeling...
_0.8475
If it's a song...I'll leave here!
_0.8477
I never expected to hear a song on the battlefield...
_0.8479
It's quite easy to do, isn't it?
_0.8481
That skill, isn't the captain's name Date?
_0.8490
Let's go!
_0.8496
I don't feel like it.
_0.8498
Are you still going to do it?
_0.8500
Is it finished?
_0.8502
It's not my fault!
_0.8504
Thank you for the reinforcements
_0.8506
Is that what it is?
_0.8508
Let me have some more fun
_0.8510
Is that the extent?
_0.8512
What are you doing!
_0.8516
I'm leaving the battlefield!
_0.8519
Be quiet!
_0.8521
Leave the rest to me!
_0.8523
I'll do the rest!
_0.8525
Fight however you like!
_0.8527
I'll leave that to you!
_0.8529
I've got my back
_0.8531
Come near me!
_0.8534
I want to join you!
_0.8536
Don't play forever!
_0.8538
You're serious about it!
_0.8540
Please leave some for me too.
_0.8542
If you want to do it, now is the time!
_0.8544
Do it in a flashy way!
_0.8546
Please visit me
_0.8550
Understood!
_0.8552
I'm out of bullets! ?
_0.8554
Damn it! What is out of bullets?
_0.8557
I have no choice but to purge
_0.8559
Damn it! Destroyed!
_0.8561
Looks like it'll be a little fun
_0.8564
I don't need this!
_0.8566
Damn it! Come quickly!
_0.8568
I failed, lend me a hand!
_0.8570
The aircraft was damaged. Ask for help!
_0.8592
do you need help?
_0.8594
Let's go to the rescue!
_0.8596
Didn't you make it in time?
_0.8598
I couldn't have supported him! ?
_0.8600
...It looks like a familiar battlefield.
_0.8602
Where is the prey?
_0.8604
If it's full of sand, it's important to maintain the aircraft.
_0.8606
I want to fight here
_0.8608
I feel like I'm going to die without prey.
_0.8610
It's all things I've never seen before.
_0.8612
How long are you going to make me wait?
_0.8619
Let's go back to the ship.
_0.8622
repay the debt immediately
_0.8626
Of course you
_0.8628
You started doing it, right?
_0.8631
Let me go too!
_0.8633
I'm going too!
_0.8635
I've already cleared all the prey around here.
_0.8637
There's no prey around here anymore.
_0.8641
Looks like there's something over there
_0.8643
Lion! Are you okay?
_0.8645
D.D. ! _ _ _ Are you okay?
_0.8647
Lion! Leave the rest to me!
_0.8649
D.D. ! _ _ _ Leave the rest to me!
_0.8651
As expected of you, Leon!
_0.8653
As expected , D.D. !
_0.8655
Looks like I need to come out too.
_0.8657
Ivanov, let's go.
_0.8659
Looks like you're ready, let's go.
_0.8661
Bullshit
_0.8663
It’s so sweet!
_0.8666
Impossible!
_0.8669
Bullshit
_0.8671
This is the end
_0.8674
It's empty.
_0.8676
You bastard!
_0.8679
Damn it!
_0.8682
That was cool
_0.8684
Don't do it
_0.8686
Next
_0.8688
Nigasan!
_0.8690
Hehehe
_0.8692
From Schwalbe 1 to each aircraft, follow me!
_0.8694
Is there anyone worthy of dancing with me?
_0.8696
Now it's time for fun
_0.8698
Shall I have you dance?
_0.8700
please entertain me
_0.8702
If you want to run away, now's the time.
_0.8704
Damn it!
_0.8707
Don't lick me!
_0.8709
That's ridiculous
_0.8711
What, are you tired of dancing?
_0.8713
The handling of the aircraft is rough.
_0.8715
I thought it would be a little more fun
_0.8717
He's unresponsive.
_0.8720
Leave it to me to deal with him.
_0.8722
Let's go to the target
_0.8724
Looks like I should do that one.
_0.8726
You're making me waste time
_0.8728
Confirmed target destruction
_0.8730
The operation is progressing smoothly.
_0.8732
I didn't expect my shield to be broken.
_0.8734
Don't get carried away just by shielding.
_0.8736
Has the shield been damaged?
_0.8738
It shouldn't hurt
_0.8740
That's a bold way to handle the aircraft.
_0.8742
That's it! Keep up the good work
_0.8744
You can dance quite well, don't you?
_0.8746
Will you do it?
_0.8748
He pretended to lick me
_0.8750
The journey isn't over yet!
_0.8752
I don't think you can defeat me at this level!
_0.8754
Being behind...
_0.8756
You think you can do me!
_0.8758
Don't get carried away!
_0.8760
still! still! I can fight!
_0.8762
I! This is me! ?
_0.8764
It's impossible, this kind of ending... it's impossible...
_0.8766
Idiot... I was the one who was knocked down...
_0.8768
Do you want to die, Hiyoko?
_0.8770
I'm slowing down to this extent
_0.8772
Don't let your guard down!
_0.8774
That little bitch
_0.8777
That's rubbish
_0.8779
I would like to thank you for your cooperation.
_0.8781
There's no problem with me being alone.
_0.8783
It's not a bad timing to get reinforcements here.
_0.8785
What happened to me...
_0.8787
Oh my god
_0.8790
It was a crappy strategy.
_0.8792
The mission is complete, let's go home.
_0.8794
I didn't even have to leave
_0.8796
Tch, time is up?
_0.8798
I guess I enjoyed dancing a little too much...
_0.8800
Damn it, I didn't make it in time!
_0.8802
I won't admit that I'm a failure! I won't approve!
_0.8804
I'm the one who failed... It's a joke that's not funny.
_0.8806
Tch, that's nonsense, I'm going to retreat.
_0.8808
Provide support fire, don't fire wasted bullets!
_0.8810
Give me rear support
_0.8812
I'll attract the enemy, support me.
_0.8814
Do close combat
_0.8816
Come forward and make a diversion
_0.8818
I'll leave the fighting to you.
_0.8820
Stay back, Hiyoko!
_0.8822
Fighting isn't just about attacking.
_0.8824
Please be quiet until the next instruction.
_0.8826
Let's dance!
_0.8828
Show us your power!
_0.8830
Do it
_0.8832
The fun begins!
_0.8834
Follow me!
_0.8836
I'll show you how to really fight!
_0.8841
I can't help it
_0.8843
If you don't take care of yourself, we'll be in trouble, Captain.
_0.8845
Don't hold me back, Captain.
_0.8847
Support the captain
_0.8849
I will take command from now on! let's go
_0.8851
I'd like Hiyokko's captain to give me a break.
_0.8853
I never thought the captain would be killed...
_0.8855
What is this song...withdrawal
_0.8857
I can't fight in this situation
_0.8859
I never thought I would be moved by a song...
_0.8861
Captain, please don't enjoy it alone.
_0.8863
You can do it, Captain.
_0.8870
Follow me!
_0.8878
I don't feel like it, but
_0.8881
That's rubbish...
_0.8883
I'm sorry, but I'll let you do it.
_0.8886
Hiyoko is
_0.8889
You're making me take your time.
_0.8891
Don't be reckless
_0.8893
Get out quickly
_0.8897
Let me leave the battlefield!
_0.8899
I told you not to look away.
_0.8901
I'll attract this guy
_0.8903
Is it time to pull up?
_0.8905
Fight however you like
_0.8907
I'll leave that to you.
_0.8910
come near me
_0.8912
I'll join you
_0.8914
Please join me here.
_0.8916
Just do what I tell you.
_0.8918
Have fun!
_0.8920
show me your strength
_0.8922
Now is the time to do it!
_0.8924
Do it!
_0.8926
Fill me!
_0.8935
Don't get too excited about this
_0.8940
Rescue quickly!
_0.8944
I'll intercept you!
_0.8946
Enemy aircraft confirmed! I'll intercept you!
_0.8948
Check out Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.8950
Check out Bandit! I'll intercept you!
_0.8952
Check out the guardian weapons! I'll intercept you!
_0.8954
Check out Havamar! I'll intercept you!
_0.8956
Check out Zentraedi! I'll intercept you!
_0.8958
Check enemy troops! I'll intercept you!
_0.8960
Check out the large flock of Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.8962
Check out the bandit squad! I'll intercept you!
_0.8964
Confirm many guardian weapons! I'll intercept you!
_0.8966
Check out many Havamar machines! I'll intercept you!
_0.8968
Many Zentraedi confirmed! I'll intercept you!
_0.8977
I'll go help you
_0.8979
Go to the rescue immediately!
_0.8983
I want to shoot down the floating islands.
_0.8985
where is the hunting ground
_0.8987
It's a frustrating place
_0.8989
Everything is huge
_0.8991
The technology on this planet is amazing that it doesn't freeze here either.
_0.8993
I miss the earth
_0.8995
what up? The war isn't over yet.
_0.8997
Head to the target!
_0.8999
Looks like something is falling
_0.9001
Checked the reaction of nearby items.
_0.9006
Now, let's go back to the ship.
_0.9011
Looks like you raised your arm
_0.9013
I guess it's gotten better. Hiyoko is
_0.9015
Well done!
_0.9017
Let me go too!
_0.9021
Now, all the enemies in this area have been wiped out.
_0.9025
There is a disturbing atmosphere
_0.9027
Lion! It's dangerous!
_0.9029
Nora! It's dangerous!
_0.9031
Lion! Was it done?
_0.9033
Nora! ...I forgive you!
_0.9035
Don't do it, Rion!
_0.9037
Don't do it, Nora!
_0.9039
I'm heading out.
_0.9041
Vermilion 1 launches.
_0.9043
Akira Ichijo will appear.
_0.9045
Is that so?
_0.9047
It's so cool
_0.9049
It's dangerous!
_0.9051
Wow!
_0.9053
Wow
_0.9055
Whoops
_0.9057
Go!
_0.9061
It's nice
_0.9063
Wow
_0.9065
Chikisho!
_0.9067
Ugh
_0.9069
Wow
_0.9071
It was bad
_0.9073
Shut up!
_0.9075
Eat it!
_0.9077
That's it
_0.9079
I'll do it, Minmei
_0.9081
Wow it started
_0.9083
Start the operation.
_0.9085
It's late
_0.9087
Okay, I caught it.
_0.9089
Come on, shall we go?
_0.9091
Soaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
_0.9094
Live with this!
_0.9096
Closed
_0.9098
Okay, just a little more
_0.9100
You're so persistent already
_0.9102
Me too
_0.9104
Can you care about me forever?
_0.9106
Next
_0.9108
Is this the enemy?
_0.9110
It’s here!
_0.9112
eh? An enemy?
_0.9114
It's finally cleared up
_0.9116
Huh, one step up?
_0.9118
Alright, we beat it!
_0.9120
Has the shield gone crazy?
_0.9122
Ah, the shield is broken.
_0.9124
Shield! Chikisho
_0.9127
Che
_0.9129
what are you doing
_0.9131
Damn you're teasing me
_0.9133
what! ?
_0.9135
ah! I made a mistake
_0.9137
Chikisho
_0.9139
Isn't it bad?
_0.9141
Damn it, please do it.
_0.9143
It hurts a lot
_0.9145
What a guy
_0.9147
Shit, leave it like this
_0.9149
It's not good at all...
_0.9151
I was beaten
_0.9153
Ha, I'm starting to lose confidence.
_0.9155
Ugh...don't threaten me
_0.9157
It can't be helped
_0.9159
Isn't he a total kid?
_0.9161
That's why I told you not to rush in alone.
_0.9163
There was damage to my wingman.
_0.9165
Was it done?
_0.9167
Oh, reinforcements have arrived?
_0.9169
He's on my side!
_0.9171
Did you finally come?
_0.9173
Damn it, I can't believe it's done.
_0.9175
eh? Has it been done?
_0.9177
What did you say
_0.9179
The operation was successful.
_0.9181
Okay, let's go back
_0.9183
Okay, mission accomplished.
_0.9186
be not in time
_0.9188
Time is up
_0.9190
I'm done with this now.
_0.9192
Ah, failure?
_0.9194
Did the mission fail?
_0.9196
I'll ask for cover fire.
_0.9198
Keep your distance from the enemy and shoot!
_0.9200
Switch to shooting mode!
_0.9202
Attract the enemy's attention
_0.9204
Start a melee battle!
_0.9206
Switch to fighting mode!
_0.9208
go on defense
_0.9210
Don't get close to the enemy!
_0.9212
Leave this to me!
_0.9214
Attack with all your might, go!
_0.9216
Shoot everything you can!
_0.9218
Attack all at once! Nice!
_0.9220
Should I seriously try it? ?
_0.9222
let's go
_0.9224
I'm not going to keep getting hit.
_0.9227
I understand.
_0.9229
Yes, yes,
_0.9231
Captain, are you okay?
_0.9233
What happened? Captain
_0.9235
Captain, you should come back once.
_0.9237
Dead? ...The captain? …
_0.9240
That's it... Captain!
_0.9242
I feel like I've forgotten, so I retreat
_0.9244
This song...I'm coming back
_0.9246
This is... let's stop fighting.
_0.9248
Wow, that's amazing
_0.9250
It's hard to do
_0.9257
Okay, let's go!
_0.9264
M...
_0.9266
I have no choice but to do it
_0.9268
Please don't feel bad
_0.9274
I did it!
_0.9276
Phew, I defeated it!
_0.9278
Please don't be reckless
_0.9287
I don't mind if you do it freely.
_0.9289
I left my back to you
_0.9291
I'll leave it to you to decide what to do.
_0.9293
Gather around!
_0.9295
Let's get together once
_0.9298
Show me your power!
_0.9302
I'm begging you for a big shot!
_0.9304
You can do it now!
_0.9306
Please make an all-out attack here!
_0.9311
Too bad, I'm out of bullets!
_0.9313
that? Are you out of bullets?
_0.9315
I shot too many times in vain.
_0.9322
Can someone come and help me?
_0.9324
Shit~, the aircraft doesn't move...
_0.9349
I can't believe I didn't make it in time!
_0.9351
Damn it! We're screwed
_0.9353
Wait, why is the island floating?
_0.9355
It's like a dream world
_0.9357
Well, I went there, but there was only sand.
_0.9359
Same size as the giants
_0.9361
Wow, that's a big piece of ice.
_0.9363
This ice is quite large if you get close to it.
_0.9365
Is something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.9367
Let's move on to the next goal!
_0.9369
There's something falling over there.
_0.9372
You're pretty far in. Is the remaining bullet okay?
_0.9374
It seems like a dead end
_0.9376
Let's return to the ship
_0.9378
Now, shall we return to the ship?
_0.9381
That was helpful
_0.9384
It seems like nerds are starting to do it a lot too.
_0.9386
Let's do it!
_0.9389
I'm going too!
_0.9392
Looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.9394
It looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.9396
I feel like there's something going on around here.
_0.9399
I feel like something might happen
_0.9402
Max! Are you okay?
_0.9404
Milia! Are you okay?
_0.9406
Lion! Take a rest
_0.9408
Max! Take a rest
_0.9410
Milia! Take a rest
_0.9413
As expected of you, Max!
_0.9415
As expected, Miria!
_0.9417
I wonder if I can provide any support?
_0.9419
The manager also prepared a great job.
_0.9421
I'm ready , let's do our best together.
_0.9423
eh? Is it really starting?
_0.9425
Hmm, will I be able to make it in time for the concert?
_0.9427
I'm a little worried, but I'll do my best as well.
_0.9429
Try your best
_0.9431
Show me your cool side once in a while
_0.9433
Wow, isn't that amazing?
_0.9435
It's dangerous if it stays like this
_0.9437
It looks painful, but are you okay?
_0.9439
Ah, it's not on.
_0.9441
Did you get hit?
_0.9443
Oh no, it's just a joke
_0.9445
That’s right!
_0.9447
You came to help me.
_0.9449
Thank you for coming to support me, right?
_0.9451
that? Is it someone on your side?
_0.9453
Hehe, thank you for your hard work
_0.9455
Yay, that was good
_0.9457
Oh no, my hair is a mess
_0.9459
I'll sing with my feelings for you
_0.9461
I'll try my best too
_0.9463
If I can help you
_0.9465
Yeah
_0.9469
It's dangerous if you stay like that, Captain.
_0.9471
I'll be in trouble if the captain doesn't take care of me.
_0.9473
Is it true that you are the captain?
_0.9475
I can't believe the captain is going to get beaten up like that...
_0.9477
Captain, are you alive?
_0.9479
Ahh! The captain...
_0.9481
As expected of Captain
_0.9483
That was cool, Captain.
_0.9485
I'll sing as hard as I can
_0.9487
I'll sing, please listen
_0.9489
I'll support you!
_0.9491
I'll do my best to help you
_0.9493
I'll try my best too
_0.9495
I'll do my best!
_0.9497
I won't lose
_0.9499
I'll do my best!
_0.9502
resting
_0.9505
I also confirmed this! We support you!
_0.9514
Let's go to the rescue immediately!
_0.9516
Ahh! You didn't make it in time.
_0.9518
Why is this...
_0.9520
I wonder if Macross here also has daughters?
_0.9522
What a great view! It's already the best!
_0.9524
When will we reach the desert oasis?
_0.9526
If you walk that far, you'll probably get covered in sand.
_0.9528
The sky is beautiful! Is it cold and the air clear?
_0.9530
Wow, that's wonderful!
_0.9532
what happened? Are you feeling unwell?
_0.9534
Let's move on to the next goal!
_0.9536
There's something falling over there.
_0.9538
There seems to be an item reaction nearby.
_0.9540
I've come a long way, I'm tired.
_0.9544
Hey, let's go back to the ship.
_0.9549
Amazing!
_0.9551
nice!
_0.9553
It is amazing!
_0.9555
Can I take you too?
_0.9557
Can I have you take me too?
_0.9559
Are the enemies around here gone now?
_0.9561
Looks like it's going to be quiet around here now.
_0.9563
There seems to be something around here
_0.9568
Shining! Are you okay?
_0.9571
Shining! Shining!
_0.9573
That's amazing, Leon!
_0.9575
That’s amazing, Akira!
_0.9577
Let's go!
_0.9579
Bastards, let's go!
_0.9581
It's Kamjin, let's go!
_0.9583
What happened ?
_0.9585
Is this the extent?
_0.9587
Yeah!
_0.9589
What are you doing! ?
_0.9591
Damn it!
_0.9594
Damn it!
_0.9596
Yay!
_0.9598
Small fry!
_0.9600
What!
_0.9602
Chikusho!
_0.9604
Chiiii!
_0.9606
Humph!
_0.9608
shut up!
_0.9611
Let me escape!
_0.9614
It's over!
_0.9616
Come on, let me do it.
_0.9618
let's go! Bastards!
_0.9620
Phew, my arm is ringing!
_0.9622
Hehe. I'll have it.
_0.9625
It's my prey!
_0.9627
You idiot!
_0.9629
That's it!
_0.9631
I'll blow it away!
_0.9633
Hmm, stubborn
_0.9635
I can't be your opponent
_0.9637
Hey, run away.
_0.9639
Small fry!
_0.9641
Ha ha!
_0.9643
Okay, what's next?
_0.9645
It's getting interesting.
_0.9647
Is that it?
_0.9649
It's new prey.
_0.9651
Yahoo!
_0.9653
I can't stand it!
_0.9655
It's an easy hunt
_0.9657
You bastard! Shield!
_0.9659
I don't need this!
_0.9661
What's going on?
_0.9664
What is it?
_0.9666
You'll do it, right?
_0.9668
Annoying
_0.9671
Damn it, don't get carried away!
_0.9673
Damn it, I can still do it!
_0.9675
Get carried away!
_0.9678
You damn thing!
_0.9681
What the hell!
_0.9683
Remember!
_0.9685
Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...
_0.9687
To think that I would be defeated...
_0.9689
Don't flinch!
_0.9691
Don't run away, go!
_0.9693
He's useless
_0.9695
It made no sense to me.
_0.9697
You useless people!
_0.9699
Well, I can't use it.
_0.9701
I don't need reinforcements!
_0.9703
Come on out!
_0.9705
What is it? Is it reinforcements?
_0.9707
It's fragile
_0.9709
Chikushou!
_0.9711
I wonder if it can last that long.
_0.9713
What, is this the end?
_0.9715
Mission accomplished, right?
_0.9717
It's not enough, let's go next time!
_0.9719
Even though it's just a breather, let's pull up!
_0.9721
what? Is your time up?
_0.9723
Is this the end?
_0.9725
Hey, it has nothing to do with strategy.
_0.9727
That's it, you bastards, retreat!
_0.9729
Shit...
_0.9731
Support me!
_0.9733
Move away and attack!
_0.9735
Shoot!
_0.9737
Teme is a decoy.
_0.9739
Attack, you idiot!
_0.9741
Just stick with it!
_0.9743
You must be having more fun than me!
_0.9745
Stay back, I'm shooting you!
_0.9747
Shut up!
_0.9749
Hey, give it to me!
_0.9751
Go wild!
_0.9753
Bring me the big one!
_0.9755
You made me serious!
_0.9757
Hahahahaha, hoohoo!
_0.9760
Huh?
_0.9762
understood!
_0.9764
Don't give me instructions!
_0.9766
I'm going to support the captain, and I'm very generous.
_0.9768
Hehe, the captain is in a pinch.
_0.9770
what up? Captain!
_0.9772
They'll do it before I can do it.
_0.9774
Now I can do it freely!
_0.9776
It's because I get carried away.
_0.9778
This... I'm going to pull out all the bastards!
_0.9780
Is this what culture is all about? It makes me cringe.
_0.9782
What, that's not bad!
_0.9784
That's a great skill, as expected.
_0.9790
Bastards, let the battle begin!
_0.9800
Wari will crash it.
_0.9803
It's boring, make me fight
_0.9807
Okay, what do you think?
_0.9810
What do you think? Did you see it!
_0.9812
what up? Do you need generous support?
_0.9814
Has it been done?
_0.9817
Damn it! Retreat!
_0.9821
Why are you retreating without permission?
_0.9823
I can't help you, it's the superior officer.
_0.9825
Do whatever you like
_0.9827
I have high expectations for you.
_0.9829
I'll let you do whatever you want.
_0.9832
Come closer to me right now
_0.9834
Can we get together?
_0.9836
Make me regret it!
_0.9839
Do it to your heart's content!
_0.9841
go! I'll pick up the bones!
_0.9843
Launch an all-out attack!
_0.9845
Do it flashy!
_0.9847
Ou!
_0.9851
Are you out of bullets?
_0.9853
Looks like I'm out of bullets
_0.9857
This is a frustrating development.
_0.9860
It's bothering me!
_0.9862
I don't need this!
_0.9865
Help me quickly!
_0.9869
It's an enemy plane! I'll intercept you!
_0.9871
It's Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.9873
It's Bandit! I'll intercept you!
_0.9875
It's a protective weapon! I'll intercept you!
_0.9877
It's Havamar! I'll intercept you!
_0.9880
It's enemy troops! I'll intercept you!
_0.9882
A horde of Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.9884
It's the bandit squad! I'll intercept you!
_0.9886
Many protective weapons! I'll intercept you!
_0.9890
Don't shoot until I get there!
_0.9898
Wait a minute!
_0.9900
Let's go to the rescue!
_0.9904
Is it the power of culture that makes islands float?
_0.9906
The culture here is different from Earth.
_0.9908
It's going to burn when it's this hot!
_0.9910
There's culture everywhere you look
_0.9912
The only way to get rid of the cold is to shoot!
_0.9914
I want something like this, all the fuss
_0.9916
If you have too much free time, target practice will hit your teammates!
_0.9918
Let's quickly head to the next battlefield!
_0.9921
There's a treasure nearby.
_0.9923
You're pretty deep here, you bastards, do you have any bullets?
_0.9927
Hey, let's go back to the ship!
_0.9929
Warina
_0.9931
Hey, I like it
_0.9934
It looks like you raised your arm.
_0.9936
It's quite a feat, isn't it?
_0.9938
As expected
_0.9940
I'm going too!
_0.9942
I’m going too!
_0.9944
With this, I've wiped out the defrans around here.
_0.9946
It looks like the defrans around here have been wiped out.
_0.9948
There seems to be something around here.
_0.9951
Looks like there's something over there
_0.9953
Lion! Get out of the way!
_0.9955
Gunness! Get out of the way!
_0.9958
Gunness! What are you doing!
_0.9961
Let's do it, Gunness!
_0.9963
Start standby
_0.9965
You can go anytime
_0.9967
Hehe, are you going to jump at me?
_0.9969
Oh?
_0.9971
So what?
_0.9973
What about it
_0.9975
Wow!
_0.9977
Tenmee!
_0.9979
Damn it!
_0.9981
Woooooooo
_0.9983
What's going on?
_0.9985
Yay
_0.9987
Nue!
_0.9989
Oooh, ugh,
_0.9991
How is it?
_0.9993
Wow
_0.9995
Ugh...
_0.9997
oh?
_0.9999
See?
_0.10001
Oh my goodness
_0.10003
good night baby
_0.10005
Lieutenant Dyson is immediately assigned to duty.
_0.10007
Come on, let's get started
_0.10009
What kind of girl is your partner today?
_0.10011
It's thrilling
_0.10013
Yeah... this!
_0.10015
I'll settle it right away
_0.10017
Oraoraoraoraora. Yahoo
_0.10019
Don't underestimate the master of reckless behavior!
_0.10021
Yahoo
_0.10023
I'll scrap it straight away.
_0.10025
I'll take care of it
_0.10027
That's right, that's right
_0.10029
Take a look
_0.10031
Okay then
_0.10033
Boom, huh~
_0.10035
It's too big. I guess I did it
_0.10037
It came out
_0.10039
I guess I'll get another one now.
_0.10041
Is it over yet? This crap!
_0.10043
Hmm, I'm feeling good
_0.10045
It's getting exciting
_0.10047
Hey!
_0.10049
What? Is it already broken?
_0.10051
It doesn't matter
_0.10055
I got it? It's a coincidence. coincidence
_0.10057
I'm not even close to that.
_0.10059
That's a bad guy
_0.10061
Chikusho
_0.10063
Ugh, you're just getting in my way.
_0.10065
What's going on?
_0.10067
What, teme!
_0.10069
Hehe, isn't it superior?
_0.10071
It's no joke.
_0.10073
Don't be silly!
_0.10075
Haha, I think I'm dead.
_0.10077
Oh no...the guys from the maintenance team are going to beat me up.
_0.10079
Heh, I'll forgive you for today...
_0.10081
It's a hindrance
_0.10083
Aren't you just running away?
_0.10085
Heh, I'm having trouble being a small fry, so I'm being left behind.
_0.10087
Friendly aircraft, requesting a response. …no good
_0.10089
What is it? hello?
_0.10091
You did it! You!
_0.10093
Don't ask for reinforcements.
_0.10095
Hey, you're just a small fry
_0.10097
Friendly troops? Trust my arm, Taku
_0.10099
You! You did a great job!
_0.10101
Oh! Don't be silly!
_0.10103
Licking it
_0.10105
Woohoo, mission accomplished.
_0.10107
Huh. Looks like I'll be in time for the date.
_0.10109
Luck is in your hands
_0.10111
It's over !? Why?
_0.10113
Oh! Did you have too much leeway?
_0.10115
Ah, ah. Today is over, break up
_0.10117
I'm not convinced.
_0.10119
Let's forget what happened
_0.10121
Hey hey hey hey
_0.10123
Don't hold back, shoot hard
_0.10125
Open a hole
_0.10127
Keep your distance and fire back.
_0.10129
Oh, let's go with our fists, let's go with our fists
_0.10131
It's an attack, I'll leave it to you.
_0.10133
Knock him out
_0.10135
It's good to be here
_0.10137
Evade all the bullets, hehe, it's easy, right?
_0.10139
It's my date, you don't mess with it.
_0.10141
Come and go wild!
_0.10143
Special attack, go!
_0.10145
Buddy, I want to see a nice place ♪
_0.10147
Damn. Nuaaaaaa
_0.10149
I don't know what will happen
_0.10152
Heh, if it's an order, I can't help it.
_0.10154
Understood ~ Huh!
_0.10156
Aiyo
_0.10158
Heh. Please do it seriously, Captain.
_0.10160
Captain !?... Hey, this isn't what I'm worried about.
_0.10162
If you spend too much, you'll go to heaven, right? Captain
_0.10164
It's no joke.
_0.10166
The captain was killed? I don't trust that!
_0.10168
It doesn't seem like it. It doesn't look like it at all! Captain!
_0.10170
I don't want to hear your weird songs
_0.10172
Hmm, what is this...I'm retreating.
_0.10174
I can't do it, I'm going home
_0.10176
Huh, that's a very skilled captain.
_0.10178
It's such an easy win for me too.
_0.10183
The battle has begun!
_0.10185
Let's start the battle~
_0.10187
Let's go!
_0.10189
Yahoo!
_0.10191
I'll let you go then.
_0.10197
Looks like I have no choice but to do it
_0.10199
Are you still motivated?
_0.10201
Sleep a little
_0.10203
Hold on!
_0.10206
Okay!
_0.10208
Not this much!
_0.10210
If it falls on me, it's an easy win!
_0.10212
What do you mean?
_0.10215
I have no choice but to retreat from here.
_0.10218
I will leave the battlefield
_0.10220
Hey, are you okay?
_0.10222
Leave the rest to me
_0.10224
I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.10226
I left my back to you
_0.10228
I trust your arm.
_0.10230
Is it okay to say that you can move freely?
_0.10232
Come closer, please
_0.10234
Gathering
_0.10238
It's date time!
_0.10240
This is the highlight!
_0.10242
Just leave it alone!
_0.10244
Give it to me in one go!
_0.10247
Ryokai!
_0.10251
I ran out of bullets
_0.10253
Are you serious about running out of bullets?
_0.10255
Did I shoot too many bullets unnecessarily?
_0.10257
I have no choice but to purge
_0.10259
I can't use this anymore
_0.10261
Damn it! It went wrong!
_0.10264
There's no problem even if you don't have it
_0.10266
I'm sorry, but can I get your help?
_0.10268
Is it okay if you rescue me?
_0.10270
Can I have you rescue me?
_0.10292
I have to help you.
_0.10295
Didn't you make it in time?
_0.10297
The support failed! ? Are you serious
_0.10299
Yay! It feels so good to be flying here!
_0.10301
It's fun with just the right amount of obstacles!
_0.10303
Huynh: The desert is vast and feels great!
_0.10305
Just fly fast!
_0.10307
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
_0.10309
It's worth flying here
_0.10314
Looks like there's an item nearby.
_0.10316
You're pretty far in. Is the number of bullets okay?
_0.10320
Come on, let's go back to the ship!
_0.10322
Sorry
_0.10327
Hugh, let's do it!
_0.10330
I'll be happy to let you go too.
_0.10332
I'll let you go too!
_0.10338
There seems to be something over there.
_0.10340
Lion! What are you doing
_0.10342
Garde! What are you doing
_0.10344
Leave quickly! Lion!
_0.10346
Leave quickly! Garde!
_0.10349
Let's do it, Garudo.
_0.10351
There seems to be no problem with the adjustment.
_0.10353
Ready for sortie completed.
_0.10355
You can go anytime.
_0.10357
Don't take it lightly.
_0.10359
I can see it.
_0.10361
No need to avoid it.
_0.10363
What!
_0.10365
Nuoooo!
_0.10367
A playful imitation.
_0.10369
Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!
_0.10374
What a guy!
_0.10376
Avoid next time!
_0.10378
Nuuu.
_0.10380
not a big deal.
_0.10382
That was delicious.
_0.10384
How about this!
_0.10387
I'll make it into chili!
_0.10389
No matter who comes, the mission will be accomplished.
_0.10391
I'll show you my full potential.
_0.10393
Start the operation.
_0.10395
If you want to run away, it's now.
_0.10397
Huh. That's sweet.
_0.10399
Enemy aircraft confirmed...! let's go!
_0.10401
It’s here!
_0.10403
Let's end this.
_0.10405
Huh. Remember the difference in ability.
_0.10407
I think anything more than that would be a waste of money.
_0.10409
He's a boring guy.
_0.10411
Was he alive? He's a guy with bad luck.
_0.10413
You can't do it. Nothing can overcome it.
_0.10415
You proved yourself to be weak.
_0.10417
Enemy plane shot down.
_0.10419
It takes to destroy the target!
_0.10421
Looks like he's the target.
_0.10423
I'll take care of this one.
_0.10425
Confirmed the destruction of the target.
_0.10427
The operation is progressing smoothly.
_0.10429
I don't want you to lick my arm.
_0.10431
Tsk! Did your shield get damaged?
_0.10433
If you think the aircraft is lighter!
_0.10435
Don't get carried away just because you broke the shield!
_0.10437
It will recover on its own.
_0.10439
It's less than a scratch.
_0.10441
I don't think I can win at that level.
_0.10443
It will pick up!
_0.10445
Ugh. Ugh.
_0.10447
I won't let you do it easily!
_0.10449
You!
_0.10451
It's not over yet!
_0.10453
What does this mean?
_0.10455
Grrrr.
_0.10457
This one will come to an end soon.
_0.10459
I can't afford to be beaten yet!
_0.10461
Well then. I'm going first.
_0.10463
Myun….
_0.10465
I...is that all there is to it?
_0.10467
It's my role to protect you.
_0.10469
Don't delay!
_0.10471
Don't rush!
_0.10473
Escape immediately.
_0.10475
It's a hindrance to the execution of the mission. Leave.
_0.10477
Leave the rest to me.
_0.10479
Looks like reinforcements.
_0.10481
There's no need for reinforcements.
_0.10483
Reinforcements at this time. How will it turn out...
_0.10485
What you did to me!
_0.10487
It doesn't seem like it's going well.
_0.10489
Couldn't I protect it?
_0.10491
The operation was successful. Return immediately.
_0.10493
Huh. This result is natural.
_0.10495
I can't break my oath.
_0.10497
If the time is up... I never thought I'd make a mistake like this...
_0.10499
can't be in time! Is that all there is to it…?
_0.10501
I won't accept this ending!
_0.10503
Have you been possessed by the god of plague?
_0.10505
It's my fault. I am everything...
_0.10507
I'm a failure in my mission.
_0.10509
Provide rear support.
_0.10511
I'll step forward. Support me.
_0.10513
Move on to gunfight.
_0.10515
Enter the fight!
_0.10517
You become the attacker.
_0.10519
Be careful not to get shot by me.
_0.10521
Going back is also necessary in battle.
_0.10523
Don't come forward too much like some idiot!
_0.10525
You can't defeat me! Get down!
_0.10527
Do you have something you want to protect too?
_0.10529
Be sure to defeat it with that one blow!
_0.10531
You finish it!
_0.10533
Woooooooo!
_0.10535
Even if I didn't have you...I wish I didn't have you.
_0.10537
The only way is to release the limiter and bring out the limit performance...
_0.10539
roger that.
_0.10541
know.
_0.10543
Understood.
_0.10545
It was confirmed that the commander's aircraft had increased damage.
_0.10547
Looks like the captain needs support.
_0.10549
The captain is in danger if things continue like this.
_0.10551
Captain, respond!
_0.10553
I never expected the captain to be killed.
_0.10555
Confirmed that the captain's aircraft was lost.
_0.10557
What is this feeling...I'm withdrawing.
_0.10559
Hmmmm...should I go home?
_0.10561
I don't feel like fighting...
_0.10563
As expected, Captain
_0.10565
He's not a bad captain.
_0.10569
Let the battle begin
_0.10573
You can go anytime!
_0.10581
I guess we have no choice but to fight...
_0.10583
Any more fighting is pointless.
_0.10585
sleep there
_0.10589
Confirm enemy retreat
_0.10591
I'm no match for you
_0.10593
Looks like that's it so far
_0.10601
Leave the rest to me!
_0.10604
Fight as you like!
_0.10606
I trust your arm
_0.10609
come here
_0.10611
Please gather together.
_0.10614
show me your strength
_0.10616
go!
_0.10620
You can do it now!
_0.10626
When the bullet ran out
_0.10630
I can't use this anymore
_0.10632
A playful imitation
_0.10634
Now comes the real deal!
_0.10637
This is more suitable for the strategy
_0.10640
call for help
_0.10663
I'm going to help!
_0.10667
If my support was in time...
_0.10669
My dream was to fly freely in the sky
_0.10671
The world is so big that islands can float.
_0.10673
Reminds me of the New Edwards base in Eden.
_0.10675
I'm looking forward to going home and having a drink.
_0.10677
It's really cold here...
_0.10679
It smells dangerous, be careful.
_0.10682
Let's quickly move on to the next goal
_0.10684
There's something falling over there.
_0.10689
Now return to the ship
_0.10691
Let's go back to the ship.
_0.10696
Isn't it amazing?
_0.10701
I will go too!
_0.10707
That place looks suspicious.
_0.10709
Lion! what are you doing
_0.10711
Isamu! what are you doing
_0.10713
Brella! what are you doing
_0.10715
Lion! leave it to me
_0.10717
Isamu! leave it to me
_0.10719
Brella! leave it to me
_0.10721
Not a bad skill, Leon.
_0.10723
Not a bad skill, Isamu.
_0.10725
Not a bad skill, Brella.
_0.10727
Why do I have to do this?
_0.10729
I'll support you, so do your best.
_0.10731
Let me show you your dreams together
_0.10733
I'm in trouble if I can't do this much.
_0.10735
It can't be helped, I'll produce it for you.
_0.10737
As long as it works the way I want it to, there will be no problems.
_0.10739
You have no choice but to do it!
_0.10741
Grab your dreams with your own power!
_0.10743
Do what you want!
_0.10745
You'll die if you stay like that.
_0.10747
Is it selfish to let people worry?
_0.10749
Feel the pain on your own
_0.10751
unbelievable! I can't believe I'm going to get killed.
_0.10753
Someone please help me! who!
_0.10755
Already! I'll do something reckless!
_0.10757
Looks like reinforcements have arrived.
_0.10759
This will give me some peace of mind
_0.10761
Is that an ally?
_0.10763
With my support, there's no way you'll fail.
_0.10765
I'm just Kuroko, but I was still able to do something useful...
_0.10767
Even if it's not singing, there's something I can do...
_0.10769
Already! Do it right!
_0.10771
I have to be stupid too.
_0.10773
There's nothing better than that!
_0.10776
Just do it, right?
_0.10779
If this continues, the captain will be in danger.
_0.10781
You're too reckless, Captain.
_0.10783
Captain, you're getting too angry.
_0.10786
The captain was killed...
_0.10788
Captain! Get out quickly!
_0.10790
Don't do it, Captain.
_0.10792
As expected, Captain
_0.10794
My song has arrived...
_0.10796

I'll support you, so do your best.

Let me see your dreams together
_0.10802
I'll do my best
_0.10804
Will there be a curtain for me to appear?
_0.10808
Get out quickly!
_0.10811
I also confirmed this!
_0.10820
Let's go to the rescue now!
_0.10822
Ah... I didn't make it in time.
_0.10824
What the heck is going on like this...
_0.10826
When I look at the sea, my soul is cleansed.
_0.10828
It's a beautiful place
_0.10830
The desert... it reminds me of Eden.
_0.10832
It's a magnificent place
_0.10834
It's really cold, isn't it?
_0.10836
It's mysterious
_0.10838
what happened? Is there something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.10840
Let's quickly move on to the next goal
_0.10842
There's something falling over there.
_0.10844
It seems like there are items falling nearby.
_0.10846
I've come a long way, are you okay?
_0.10849
Let's go back to the ship.
_0.10851
Come on, let's go back to the ship.
_0.10859
Please take me too.
_0.10861

_0.10863
Looks like you've defeated the enemies around here.
_0.10865
Looks like I've defeated the enemies around here.
_0.10867
There seems to be something around here
_0.10872
Isamu! Are you okay?
_0.10874
Garde! Are you okay?
_0.10877
Isamu! Isamu!
_0.10879

As expected of you, Garde!
_0.10886
I'm ready
_0.10888
I'll come out
_0.10890
I can go anytime
_0.10892
I'm tired of waiting...
_0.10894
I'll show you the best sky
_0.10896

_0.10898

_0.10900
Faster than anyone else, higher than anyone else
_0.10902
do what you want
_0.10904
Shall I pilot it?
_0.10906
I need to fly faster
_0.10908
Do you like singing?
_0.10910
you're not fast
_0.10912
It's not you
_0.10914
Maybe I should have steered it
_0.10916
Looks like reinforcements have arrived
_0.10918
I wonder if I can fly high?
_0.10921
You were flying the most freely
_0.10923
Did your wish come true?
_0.10925
Did you hear the song?
_0.10927
I'll captivate you
_0.10929
i sing
_0.10931
How about this?
_0.10934
That's fine
_0.10937
Are you like that?
_0.10939
Is it fun to fly with that?
_0.10941
I wish you could sing too
_0.10943
you're different
_0.10945
so sorry
_0.10947
Goodbye
_0.10949

_0.10951
Are you having fun flying?
_0.10953

_0.10955
I'll support you
_0.10957

_0.10965
Let's do it
_0.10967
what happened?
_0.10969
come down
_0.10971
I wonder if it's okay?
_0.10973
I checked. Looks like I need help
_0.10975
It's the enemy
_0.10977
Vajra
_0.10979
Bandit.
_0.10981
It's a protective weapon.
_0.10983
Havamar
_0.10985
Zentraedi
_0.10987
Do I need help?
_0.10989
Shall we go to the rescue?
_0.10991
You didn't make it in time.
_0.10993
That was unfortunate.
_0.10995
The sky goes on forever
_0.10997
I want to sing more
_0.10999
It's a good place to sing
_0.11001
Far higher, to the end of the sky
_0.11003
A song seems to be echoing here
_0.11005
It's a strange place
_0.11007
Why doesn't it fly?
_0.11009
Let's go quickly
_0.11011
Looks like there's something over there
_0.11013
There is an item reaction nearby.
_0.11015
I've come a long way
_0.11018
I'll go back to the ship.
_0.11020
Now, let's go back to the ship.
_0.11022
Is this a feeling of gratitude?
_0.11025
Was saved? Is that okay?
_0.11027
That's amazing
_0.11029
Your sky has expanded again
_0.11031
As expected
_0.11033
I'll help you too
_0.11035
Please take me too.
_0.11037
Now this is my territory
_0.11039
Now this is my territory.
_0.11043
There's some kind of reaction over there.
_0.11045
Lion! Are you okay?

_0.11062
Okay, let's go all flashy.
_0.11064
I'll make a perfect decision!
_0.11066
We'll continue the live show over there.
_0.11068
Hey! Stop
_0.11070
Damn it.
_0.11072
Buckyaro!
_0.11074
You did it!
_0.11076
What are you doing?
_0.11078
Isn't it nice!
_0.11080
Ah!
_0.11082
I hit you!
_0.11085
Yeah!
_0.11087
What is it?
_0.11089
Oh no!

Stop fighting! Don't fight!
_0.11119
Don't shoot. Missiles are worthless.
_0.11121
You're still alive...I'll tell you more.
_0.11123
Damn it! The gallery has decreased again!
_0.11125
I'm not singing for this!
_0.11127
My song is not a tool for murder!
_0.11129
It's here
_0.11131
Did you come to hear it? I'll impress you a lot!
_0.11133
Now! Let's go for one shot!
_0.11135
Oh, let me shoot!
_0.11137
Even if we shoot each other, nothing will come of it.
_0.11139
Stop killing each other! Listen to my song!
_0.11141
Oh my gosh
_0.11143
If this happens, avoid it.
_0.11145
Shield went crazy
_0.11148
Fighting is worthless!
_0.11150
Are you saying you can't listen to my song? ?
_0.11153
Don't make a fuss.
_0.11155
I can't wait to fall! The live show is about to begin!
_0.11157
It's so annoying!
_0.11159
Things like this can't stop me from singing!
_0.11161
Listen carefully!
_0.11163
Don't get in the way!
_0.11165
Please listen to my song properly...
_0.11167
I need you to fix it again
_0.11169
Remember...next time...I'll definitely make you feel it!
_0.11171
While. It's a mess. Chikusho!
_0.11173
Why aren't you listening to my song?!
_0.11176
What's okay?
_0.11178
Who the hell is this guy causing trouble for?
_0.11180
Yeah? What is it?
_0.11182
Oh my god...
_0.11184
Geez. Damn it.
_0.11186
The number of galleries has increased, heh, it's on fire!
_0.11188

_0.11190
For now, you guys, listen to my song
_0.11192

Stop it!
_0.11196
It's not a joke.
_0.11198
Hehe, everyone is too excited

There will come a time when you'll understand my sound too.
_0.11202
What, is everyone gone?
_0.11204
Well, the live show isn't over, so listen carefully!
_0.11206
I can't sing enough, it's like this...
_0.11208
Ah, Teme! Listen till the end!
_0.11210
Ha, that's not interesting, no one listens to my song.
_0.11212
What is it that I'm missing...
_0.11214

_0.11216
Stop! Don't shoot!
_0.11218
Don't shoot! Never shoot!
_0.11220
Shoot through his heart!
_0.11222
Even if I forced it down with force, it wouldn't help!
_0.11224
Power is not enough!
_0.11226
Come closer and let me hear your song
_0.11228
Don't ever lay your hands on it!
_0.11230
You should be quiet!
_0.11232
So, quietly listen to my song.

It's getting hot!
_0.11242
Let's go!
_0.11244
Kaa, I'll burn it!
_0.11246
It's so noisy, so much
_0.11248
He's really bad at handling people.
_0.11250
I want it! You can't, you can't divide it!
_0.11252
You don't understand, Captain San.
_0.11254
It's interfering with the song, sorry
_0.11256
Hey, stop fighting and listen to my song!
_0.11258
So it would have been no use even if we shot each other...
_0.11260
Hey! ? Do not die! There are still songs I want to hear!
_0.11262
Damn...
_0.11264
What... it's not bad.
_0.11266
Don't come to this sound!
_0.11268
I feel like singing too!

Is there no choice but to fight?
_0.11724
Why with you...
_0.11726
Sorry
_0.11728
It'll hurt a little though...
_0.11731
Alright! I did it!
_0.11733
It's easy for me to win
_0.11735
That's about it
_0.11737
Please don't be reckless anymore
_0.11740
I'm sorry, but I'll have to withdraw.
_0.11745
Leave the rest to me!
_0.11748
do it freely
_0.11750
do what you like
_0.11752
I will leave it up to you
_0.11754
Gather at my place
_0.11756
Can we get together for once?
_0.11759
Fire!
_0.11761
Let's get excited!
_0.11764
Bomber!
_0.11766
It's burning up like crazy!
_0.11772
fault? Are you out of bullets?
_0.11774
I'm out of bullets
_0.11776
I think I shot too much
_0.11778
Ahh! I got it!
_0.11780
Not yet!
_0.11782
It's still okay!
_0.11784
I don't need this
_0.11786
It was a hindrance.
_0.11788
Help me
_0.11790
Can I get rescued?
_0.11792
please lend me a hand
_0.11795
Enemy aircraft confirmed! I'll intercept you!
_0.11797
Check out Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.11799
Check out Bandit! I'll intercept you!
_0.11801
Check out the guardian weapons! I'll intercept you!
_0.11803
Check out Havamar! I'll intercept you!
_0.11805
Check out Zentraedi! I'll intercept you!
_0.11807
Check enemy troops! I'll intercept you!
_0.11809
Check out the large flock of Vajra! I'll intercept you!
_0.11811
Check out the bandit squad! I'll intercept you!
_0.11813
Confirm many guardian weapons! I'll intercept you!
_0.11815
Check out many Havamar machines! I'll intercept you!
_0.11817
Many Zentraedi confirmed! I'll intercept you!
_0.11819
I also confirmed this! I'll support you!
_0.11829
I couldn't make it in time...
_0.11831
already! You have failed!
_0.11833
It's a wonderful planet full of water and greenery.
_0.11835
A canary that can no longer sing will be washed away at sea.
_0.11837
What is this heat...
_0.11839
Sigh, I'm thirsty, do you want something cold?
_0.11841
It's like there's magic
_0.11843
The world is big!
_0.11846
Let's quickly move on to the next goal!
_0.11849
There is an item reaction nearby.
_0.11851
You're pretty far in, are you okay with the remaining bullets?
_0.11854
I have to get back to the ship.
_0.11856
Hey, let's go back to the ship.
_0.11858
thank you
_0.11862
great
_0.11864
As expected, it might be a bit cool
_0.11867
I'm going too!
_0.11870
There are no more enemies around here now.
_0.11872
There are no more enemies around here now.
_0.11875
It's weird over there.
_0.11878
Lion! What are you doing?
_0.11880
Basara! What are you doing?
_0.11882
Mr. Gamlin! Are you okay?
_0.11884
Lion! Are you okay?
_0.11886
already! Basara!
_0.11888
Mr. Gamlin! Leave the rest to me!
_0.11890
Isn't that amazing, Leon?
_0.11892
Isn't that amazing, Basara?
_0.11894
Mr. Gamlin looks great!
_0.11896
I'm heading out.
_0.11898
let's go!
_0.11900
Fulfilling our responsibilities as Diamond Force
_0.11902
Huh, as expected.
_0.11904
This is like this
_0.11906
Is this the extent?
_0.11908
Kuu.
_0.11910
I'm sorry.
_0.11912
It's gone!
_0.11914
Late!
_0.11916
Go!
_0.11918
Wow!
_0.11920
Wow.
_0.11922
Wow!
_0.11924
Nuah.
_0.11926
Damn.
_0.11928
Argh!
_0.11930
what!
_0.11932
Oh!
_0.11934
Sigh.
_0.11936
Hmph
_0.11939
From now on, we will start taking action.
_0.11941
Arrive at the operational area and carry out your mission.
_0.11943
Don't run away!
_0.11945
Shoot it down!
_0.11947
captured
_0.11949
Woooooooooooo!
_0.11951
Zeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
_0.11953
On the honor of Diamond Force!
_0.11955
I'll drop it this time
_0.11957
received
_0.11959
Shatter!
_0.11962
Enemy aircraft destroyed
_0.11964
shot down
_0.11966
That is?
_0.11968
It's here
_0.11970
Reinforcements?
_0.11972
destroy the target
_0.11974
This is fine
_0.11976
I did it
_0.11978
Nu, damn it
_0.11980
Shield was damaged
_0.11982
Ugh, the shield
_0.11984
Tsk, get in the way
_0.11986
There is no problem at this level
_0.11988
Okay, this one
_0.11990
Damn, I can't avoid it
_0.11993
I'm saying it's a nuisance!
_0.11995
Any more damage than this is bad...
_0.11997
Shit, I can't shake it off.
_0.11999
Get out of the way! You're in the way!
_0.12001
stupid! ?
_0.12003
Ugh, I can't lose
_0.12005
I can't stand being dropped!
_0.12007
Foaaaah!
_0.12009
I was shot down...
_0.12011
Mylene-san must have seen it again...
_0.12013
Friendly aircraft, badly damaged, return home.
_0.12015
Friendly aircraft, leave the theater.
_0.12017
Hey, don't be crazy
_0.12019
Evacuate! Evacuate immediately!
_0.12021
Respond! Can't you hear me?
_0.12023
Was it shot down? ? Damn it
_0.12025
Have friendly forces come?
_0.12027
This is Gamlin, thank you for your support.
_0.12029
Are you friendly?
_0.12031
Those guys !
_0.12033
What!
_0.12035
Don't worry!
_0.12037
Okay, we win.
_0.12039
Mission accomplished, return home.
_0.12041
I will protect Mylène.
_0.12043
Well, I guess I didn't make it in time.
_0.12045
Scheduled time, elapsed time...
_0.12047
Hey...I'm coming back!
_0.12049
Oh my god...
_0.12051
The operation failed...I am disqualified from the Diamond Force.
_0.12053
The operation failed. withdraw.
_0.12055
Retaliate by shooting
_0.12057
ask for cover fire
_0.12059
Attack while keeping your distance from the enemy.
_0.12061
Fight back with a fight
_0.12063
Smash it!
_0.12065
Approach the enemy, be careful.
_0.12067
you go down
_0.12069
leave this to me
_0.12071
Take a defensive stance
_0.12073
Not yet! Full power attack!
_0.12075
Okay, launch an all-out attack.
_0.12077
Give me the final blow
_0.12079
Woooooo! It's not free!
_0.12081
I can't stand losing!
_0.12083
I am Diamond Force! Oooh!
_0.12085
Understood!
_0.12088
Do you get it
_0.12090
Captain. Don't overdo it.
_0.12092
Captain, it's dangerous.
_0.12094
Captain, I'll support you. Please give me instructions.
_0.12096
Captain's machine lost! ? Captain...
_0.12098
Captain, please respond! Captain! ?
_0.12100
Woooooooooo! Well done Captain!
_0.12102
What's this feeling...I'm retreating.
_0.12104
This song...I can't fight anymore
_0.12106
This battle is pointless...
_0.12108
Your skills are not up to par.
_0.12110
His skill is as good as Diamond Force.
_0.12117
Okay, let's go!
_0.12119
I'll do it!
_0.12126
Why is this...
_0.12128
Can't you do something about it?
_0.12131
Please be patient!
_0.12134
That's it!
_0.12146
I don't mind having people do whatever they want.
_0.12148
I trust your arm.
_0.12151
Come here for a moment
_0.12156
I'll do my best!
_0.12159
Kick them away!
_0.12161
Do it!
_0.12168
I'm out of bullets
_0.12171
What a thing...
_0.12178
Sorry, can I get some help?
_0.12201
I have to go help!
_0.12205
Oh my god!
_0.12207
Music is something we listen to at times like this.
_0.12209
Looks like inside a resort ship
_0.12211
Damn, how hot
_0.12213
We are the weakest in nature.
_0.12215
There is such an unknown planet
_0.12217
It's like I'm seeing a vision
_0.12220
Let's quickly move on to the next goal!
_0.12222
There's something falling over there.
_0.12228
Now, let's go back to the ship.
_0.12231
Thank you, that was helpful
_0.12235
I'm looking forward to that skill.
_0.12238
let me go too
_0.12246
Are you okay? Lion
_0.12248
Sing! Basara
_0.12250
Mylene! OK?
_0.12252
Rion should rest.
_0.12254
Sing! Basara!
_0.12256
Mylene! please rest
_0.12258
Let's do it, Leon.
_0.12260
Don't do it, Basara!
_0.12262
As expected of you, Mylène!
_0.12264
Maximilian Genus, let's take off.
_0.12266
Each Valkyrie squad. Scramble now! I'll be there too!
_0.12268
Set out.
_0.12270
slow.
_0.12272
It's pointless.
_0.12274
Huh.
_0.12276
Kuuuu
_0.12280
That's it.
_0.12282
sorry.
_0.12284
Don't run away!
_0.12286
This much...
_0.12288
Don't do it
_0.12290
It's bad
_0.12292
no problem.
_0.12295
Yeah! ?
_0.12297
There's more.
_0.12299
I won't miss it!
_0.12301
Let me do it.
_0.12303
This is Max! Start the operation.
_0.12305
I wish you all success!
_0.12307
I'll show you how Maximilian Genus fights!
_0.12309
There!
_0.12311
I found it!
_0.12313
Check target.
_0.12315
Don't think you can run away from me.
_0.12317
I'll show you my skills!
_0.12319
Let's go from here!
_0.12321
I don't have that level of skill.
_0.12323
Let me do it like this!
_0.12325
Any further resistance is futile.
_0.12327
You did it!
_0.12329
I'm also a former ace pilot.
_0.12331
He is not called a genius.
_0.12333
I have to do it.
_0.12335
This is it.
_0.12337
Prioritize the destruction of the target.
_0.12339
Has your old intuition returned?
_0.12341
The operation is progressing smoothly.
_0.12343
Confirmed target destruction.
_0.12345
I never expected that the shield would be destroyed.
_0.12347
Shield! That's not good...
_0.12349
If you avoid it all, it won't be a problem.
_0.12351
What, this much?
_0.12353
Huh. interesting.
_0.12355
It's still a long way off compared to what I used to be.
_0.12357
Damn, are you going to make it in time?
_0.12359
This situation is dangerous...
_0.12361
The enemy is also quite skilled.
_0.12363
No!
_0.12365
Is it impossible?
_0.12367
It's not like it was back then.
_0.12369
There must still be a hand!
_0.12371
It's too early to call it despair.
_0.12373
Damn it! I never thought I could get this far...!
_0.12375
Kuuu. It was done.
_0.12377
Ahh! Unpalatable! Please follow me!
_0.12379
Does that mean my arms have become dull too?
_0.12381
Are you okay.
_0.12383
Act calmly.
_0.12385
come on!
_0.12387
Escape! hurry up!
_0.12390
What can I say?
_0.12392
Reinforcements in this scene. It's not a bad trend.
_0.12394
Looks like reinforcements. appreciate.
_0.12396
Friendly forces? But I can't let my guard down.
_0.12398
Did you get hit...
_0.12400
Oh my God...
_0.12402
What? Oh my god...
_0.12404
Operation completed. Return immediately.
_0.12406
Milia. I did it.
_0.12408
It was a no-brainer strategy.
_0.12410
Time is up! Damn it! Retreat!
_0.12412
Didn't make it in time...
_0.12414
Is it time? It is impossible to continue the operation.
_0.12416
The strategy is a failure. Leave the front line immediately!
_0.12418
I have to retreat as soon as possible.
_0.12420
I can't believe I'm going to fail
_0.12422
Alright! Cover fire begins!
_0.12424
Ask for my backup.
_0.12426
I want you to support me.
_0.12428
Get ahead!
_0.12430
Shift to combat. Come forward!
_0.12432
Disturb your opponent in close combat.
_0.12434
Leave it to me.
_0.12436
Please be very careful.
_0.12438
Calm down.
_0.12440
Let's finish it!
_0.12442
This is the last one!
_0.12444
now! Shoot!
_0.12446
There's more to come!
_0.12448
This will be the last time!
_0.12450
It's a dangerous bet!
_0.12452
That's right.
_0.12454
Huh. know.
_0.12456
Yeah. All right.
_0.12458
It looks like the captain is in danger...
_0.12460
At this rate, the captain...
_0.12462
Captain, what will you do if you don't do it properly?
_0.12464
Was the captain killed?
_0.12466
Captain, hurry up and escape!
_0.12468
I can't fight like this...
_0.12470
That's right, I'll retreat immediately.
_0.12472
Is this...should we stop fighting?
_0.12474
This feeling...I'm going to retreat
_0.12476
He's a very skilled captain.
_0.12478
It's still a long way off compared to what I used to be.
_0.12485
Take off!
_0.12493
Looks like we have no choice but to fight
_0.12497
Thank you for your patience
_0.12509
I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.12512
Fight as you like
_0.12514
I trust your arm
_0.12517
Do you mind if I come here?
_0.12521
show me your power
_0.12523
act quickly
_0.12526
Launch an all-out attack!
_0.12528
now! Do it!
_0.12534
Is it out of bullets?
_0.12537
Did I shoot too many bullets?
_0.12540
Don't cry for the name of a genius
_0.12569
I'll come to the rescue immediately!
_0.12572
Failing to support...
_0.12574
Ah... beautiful
_0.12576
The climate is mild
_0.12578
It's a big place, there aren't many places to hide.
_0.12580
It's full of sand, and the maintenance of the aircraft is difficult.
_0.12582
This reminds me of an old operation where I sortied.
_0.12584
I have a really bad feeling
_0.12587
Let's move on to the next goal
_0.12591
We're pretty far in. Are the remaining bullets okay?
_0.12600
I look forward to your continued success.
_0.12603
let me go too
_0.12612
Mylene! Are you okay?
_0.12615
Lion! I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.12617
Mylene! I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.12619
Millia! I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.12622
Well done, Mylène!
_0.12625
Milia Farina Genas, I'm heading out.
_0.12627
I'll come out!
_0.12629
Let's go.
_0.12631
It's a waste.
_0.12633
It doesn't hit.
_0.12635
It's sweet.
_0.12637
What do you mean!
_0.12639
What is that?
_0.12641
What a guy...!
_0.12643
Let's go.
_0.12645
There.
_0.12648
What's!
_0.12652
Already!
_0.12654
What!
_0.12656
that's all?
_0.12658
Wait!
_0.12660
I won't miss it!
_0.12662
Follow me!
_0.12664
I'll shoot down all of them.
_0.12666
We can't protect the citizens unless someone fights!
_0.12668
It reminds me of when I was young.
_0.12670
Hehe. There.
_0.12672
I won't let you escape
_0.12674
I found it.
_0.12676
Come learn from the beginning!
_0.12678
It's a chance!
_0.12680
It's late!
_0.12682
Are you going to let me escape?
_0.12684
Now, how are you going to deal with it?
_0.12686
It's not very satisfying.
_0.12688
Please be quiet!
_0.12690
That's weak.
_0.12692
It's a natural result.
_0.12694
Destroying the target is your top priority.
_0.12696
I'll hit the target!
_0.12698
That seems to be the goal. I'll destroy it.
_0.12700
I have confirmed that the target has been defeated.
_0.12702
I can still do it too.
_0.12704
I did it
_0.12706
I can't stand the hardship at all.
_0.12708
It wasn't just that the shield was broken.
_0.12710
I don't think this is enough to make me feel good!
_0.12712
No big deal!
_0.12715
Damn it! Don't let your guard down.
_0.12717
That's not good.
_0.12719
My precious aircraft!
_0.12721
At this level, I won't let you down.
_0.12723
Is it worth it to be defeated?
_0.12725
Ugh. Ahh.
_0.12727
Damn, this is me!
_0.12729
I...maybe no longer good enough.
_0.12731
Aaaaaaa!
_0.12733
The aircraft won't last anymore!
_0.12735
I don't want to get old...
_0.12737
Max….
_0.12739
What do you mean?
_0.12741
Don't cause more worries!
_0.12743
Just don't get in my way!
_0.12745
Stay strong!
_0.12747
What are you doing!
_0.12749
Already! Escape quickly!
_0.12751
Start over from the basics of piloting!
_0.12753
Looks like the insurance was on time.
_0.12755
I shot down all the aircraft.
_0.12757
It's late! What have you been doing so far?
_0.12759
That sucks!
_0.12761
Damn, did you get hit?
_0.12763
I was killed and it was destroyed...
_0.12765
It is my duty to protect the citizens!
_0.12767
Mission complete. I'm going back.
_0.12769
It's like it was successful because of me.
_0.12771
Damn, I think I was too distracted by the enemy.
_0.12773
I couldn't believe I didn't make it in time...
_0.12775
Time is up! What the heck...
_0.12777
I won't accept it ending like this!
_0.12779
Looks like Ace Milia is up to this point...
_0.12781
I can't believe I'm going to fail...
_0.12783
Please provide cover fire.
_0.12785
Go to support.
_0.12787
I will give you a support mission.
_0.12789
Just shove it in!
_0.12791
I'll leave the close combat to you.
_0.12793
I wonder if you can jump into my pocket.
_0.12795
Stop doing dangerous imitations!
_0.12797
Remember to step back a little!
_0.12799
Focus on defense!
_0.12801
You have no choice but to do it!
_0.12803
Now's your chance.
_0.12805
Show your determination!
_0.12807
I'll bring you flowers!
_0.12809
Take this responsibility firmly!
_0.12811
This is the proof of an ace!
_0.12813
I see. That's fine.
_0.12815
I already know.
_0.12817
Yes, yes.
_0.12819
It would be better if I were the captain.
_0.12821
Captain, what a shame.
_0.12823
Is the captain okay?
_0.12825
What a sloppy captain.
_0.12827
What will you do if the captain is defeated?
_0.12829
Have you been beaten?
_0.12831
What's! How does this feel? I'm withdrawing
_0.12833
Ahhh. It seems like my lifespan has been extended.
_0.12835
Deculture!
_0.12837
Don't you have very good arms?
_0.12839
I'm counting on your skill.
_0.12847
I'll do it!
_0.12854
Looks like we'll have no choice but to fight
_0.12856
Are you still fighting?
_0.12858
Sorry
_0.12860
Sleep with this
_0.12864
I'm no match for you.
_0.12873
Leave the rest to me!
_0.12876
Fight as you please
_0.12878
I trust your arm.
_0.12881
Please come over here for a moment.
_0.12883
Could you please meet up?
_0.12886
Show your power!
_0.12888
You can do it
_0.12891
Do it in a flashy way!
_0.12893
All-out attack!
_0.12899
I'm out of bullets
_0.12901
I'm out of bullets
_0.12903
I think I shot too many bullets.
_0.12906
What's that!
_0.12908
I can't use this anymore
_0.12910
I'll purge
_0.12912
This is a bit of a nuisance.
_0.12914
Please lend me a hand
_0.12916
I'm calling for help.
_0.12939
I'm going to help!
_0.12942
Ahh! I didn't make it in time
_0.12944
Oh my god!
_0.12946
I think you can have a good rest here.
_0.12948
I'm grateful to be able to forget my position and fly.
_0.12950
It's hot, let's make it rain and somehow lower the temperature!
_0.12952
I can't let Mylène out in this temperature.
_0.12954
I have a certain amount of confidence in singing.
_0.12956
I'm concerned about my citizens.
_0.12958
Is there something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.12962
I checked the reaction of an item nearby.
_0.12966
I'll go back to the ship.
_0.12968
Now, let's go back to the ship.
_0.12971
Sorry, I helped you.
_0.12974
As expected!
_0.12976
Keep up the good work
_0.12979
I'll let you go too.
_0.12982
Now I've wiped out all the enemies around here.
_0.12986
That place looks suspicious.
_0.12990
Max! What are you doing!
_0.12992
Clan! Are you okay?
_0.12994
Lion! take a rest
_0.12996
Max! Still, he's a genius!
_0.12998
Clan! take a rest
_0.13000
Let's do it, Leon!
_0.13002
Way to go, Max!
_0.13004
Let's do it, Clan!
_0.13006
It's okay.... I can do it...!
_0.13008
Alto Saotome will appear.
_0.13010
Skull 4 , sortie
_0.13012
Let me do it!
_0.13014
Gah...!
_0.13016
Ugh
_0.13018
What are you doing !!
_0.13020
You ! _
_0.13023
Go ahead !!
_0.13025
Look... !!
_0.13027
Wow!
_0.13029
Damn it!
_0.13032
Argh!
_0.13035
What !?
_0.13037
Ku…… !!
_0.13039
Just keep going
_0.13041
It's sweet.
_0.13044
I'll finish it right away
_0.13047
start the operation
_0.13049
I can do it...
_0.13051
I won't show mercy
_0.13053
I won't let you escape
_0.13055
Woooooooooooooooooo ! _
_0.13057
Something about you!
_0.13059
Attack !!
_0.13061
You're so persistent!
_0.13063
It's almost there
_0.13065
Let me do whatever you like
_0.13067
I know the hawk
_0.13069
It's not a big deal.
_0.13072
Let’s go !!
_0.13074
Come on!
_0.13076
One after another... so much
_0.13078
You destroyed the target!
_0.13081
It's over
_0.13083
Damn, I can't use the shield anymore.
_0.13085
Shield! Damn it
_0.13087
Tsk, the shield
_0.13089
Do not get in the way!
_0.13091
It's just a scratch
_0.13093
It's annoying
_0.13095
That's a nice song...
_0.13097
It's nothing, that's all
_0.13099
Fuck……. what's with that
_0.13101
I guessed it...
_0.13104
Not yet !
_0.13106
Take it easy
_0.13108
You !?
_0.13110
Are you going to die? In a place like this
_0.13112
Oh my god...
_0.13114
Is this what it is...I am
_0.13116
In a place like this...I
_0.13118
Don't be scared
_0.13120
You idiot! Avoid it properly
_0.13122
Hey! Are you OK?
_0.13124
What are you in love with?
_0.13126
You idiot! That was so reckless...!
_0.13128
Damn, I was dropped.
_0.13130
What? Are you on my side?
_0.13132
Is that... friendly forces?
_0.13134
Support...I can do it by myself .
_0.13136
Stop it!
_0.13138
What is happening... !?
_0.13140
Are you being attacked !? Damn it!
_0.13142
I'll be late for class. I'll be right back
_0.13144
Is it finished...
_0.13146
Mission accomplished, let's go home
_0.13148
Isn't it a mess... Damn it?
_0.13150
Tsk! Is it time already?
_0.13153
This guy too...!
_0.13155
What is this !?
_0.13157
… damn it !!
_0.13159
Cover fire, I asked for it.
_0.13161
Shoot!
_0.13163
Support me with shooting
_0.13165
Set up a fight!
_0.13167
Fight in close combat
_0.13169
Can you do close combat?
_0.13171
Get away !! (Hike)
_0.13173
wait! I'll become an old man!
_0.13175
I'll hold it!
_0.13177
Do it !
_0.13179
You can do it now !
_0.13181
Cheer me!
_0.13183
Do you want to make me serious?
_0.13185
Shall I do it...!
_0.13187
Finish it quickly or let's go!
_0.13189
...yes sir
_0.13191
I know
_0.13193
Ah, I understand.
_0.13195
That doesn't seem like a captain.
_0.13197
Although he is a captain, he is lazy.
_0.13199
Did your arm fall off? Captain
_0.13201
Captain!
_0.13203
The captain has been defeated! ?
_0.13205
Which one! Who was the captain !?
_0.13207
This... I can't fight.
_0.13209
I can't help it, should I pull out?
_0.13211
This feeling... I'm going home
_0.13213
As expected of the captain
_0.13215
Of course it's a captain's skill.
_0.13235
Not this much
_0.13252
I'll show you your strength
_0.13254
Here's your chance!
_0.13264
I need to replenish my ammo
_0.13271
unnecessary!
_0.13273
Give me a hand!
_0.13275
I'm sorry, but can you help me?
_0.13298
I have to go help right away!
_0.13302
Support failed! ? Damn it!
_0.13304
Horizon and white clouds...
_0.13306
This is the sky. real sky
_0.13308
It's like a fairy tale
_0.13310
endless sand
_0.13312
Wow...it's a mysterious place.
_0.13314
I would love to stand on a stage like this
_0.13316
What's the matter? Is something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.13325
Sorry, I was saved.
_0.13330
I can't lose either.
_0.13341
Michelle! Are you okay?
_0.13343
Luka! Are you okay?
_0.13346
Michelle! Take a rest
_0.13348
Luka! Take a rest
_0.13351
Way to go, Michelle!
_0.13353
Don't do it, Luka!
_0.13355
Michael Blanc, sortie!
_0.13357
Skull 2 launch preparations are complete.
_0.13359
Alright! Let's go!
_0.13361
Let's eat it!
_0.13363
It's dangerous!
_0.13365
You sweetheart.
_0.13367
Wow
_0.13369
Damn it! What an attack!
_0.13371
ugly
_0.13373
It's over
_0.13376
Damn it
_0.13378
Ugh...!
_0.13380
Wow
_0.13383
I won't do it.
_0.13386
Oops.
_0.13389
It's empty.
_0.13391
See you
_0.13393
Don't get too hot.
_0.13395
Let's get started.
_0.13397
Well, do you want to do it?
_0.13399
I'll take care of it with a sniper.
_0.13401
You can't fool a sniper's eyes.
_0.13404
I'll put everything into this one attack!
_0.13406
I'll clean it up now.
_0.13408
I won't take it off!
_0.13410
I won't let you escape!
_0.13412
It's tough!
_0.13414
It's late!
_0.13416
Bingo!
_0.13418
This result is natural.
_0.13420
Oh, is it over already?
_0.13422
Is that the goal? Shoot!
_0.13424
Check target. Destroy.
_0.13426
Don't think you can escape from my eyes.
_0.13428
I guess I did the obvious thing.
_0.13431
I hope this goes easy.
_0.13433
I don't think the shield will be destroyed...
_0.13435
Damn it! Shield!
_0.13437
If it's just a shield, there's no problem.
_0.13439
Hmm. It's annoying.
_0.13441
I'll have you pay for your injuries.
_0.13444
Because the real thing is about to happen.
_0.13446
It makes you cold.
_0.13448
You can still do it.
_0.13452
No more!
_0.13454
You... you bastard!
_0.13456
This might be someone who is in a pinch.
_0.13458
Temeee!
_0.13460
No luck.
_0.13462
Elder Sister…. Am I this far...?
_0.13464
Sorry, Clan...
_0.13466
Damn that idiot!
_0.13468
It's on my ass!
_0.13470
That's really unreasonable.
_0.13472
You idiot! Come back quickly!
_0.13474
Get out quickly!
_0.13476
why…. Why is this happening? ?
_0.13478
Thank you for the reinforcements.
_0.13480
Maybe this will make it a little easier?
_0.13482
Are you friendly? Nice follow.
_0.13484
Really, you should read the atmosphere.
_0.13486
Damn it !
_0.13488
Are you serious….
_0.13490
The operation is over. I'll be back immediately.
_0.13492
If this is the case, you'll be in time for your date.
_0.13494
I told you. I'm sure one shot will hit both the woman and the bullet.
_0.13496
it's time. That's it.
_0.13498
I never thought I would run out of time...
_0.13500
Tsk! Is it already time?
_0.13502
I can't believe the mission will fail. withdraw.
_0.13504
There's no point in continuing this any longer. withdraw.
_0.13506
I don't think I'll take it off. Is today a bad day?
_0.13508
I'll leave the supporting fire to you.
_0.13510
I'll rush in. I asked for help!
_0.13512
Show me your level of shooting.
_0.13514
It's my sniper. Plunge in with confidence!
_0.13516
Fighting battle! Go!
_0.13518
Make sure to bring it into close combat.
_0.13520
Well, you should stand back.
_0.13522
You're defending!
_0.13524
Leave this to me.
_0.13526
Now's your chance!
_0.13528
Give me one shot!
_0.13530
Please leave a good part for me too.
_0.13532
Even here, your life is at stake!
_0.13534
I will definitely defeat him!
_0.13536
Don't make me serious!
_0.13539
Understood.
_0.13541
Sure!
_0.13543
Go to support the captain!
_0.13545
Please stand back! Captain!
_0.13547
Captain! I'll support you.
_0.13549
The captain was killed...
_0.13551
I never expected that the captain would be defeated.
_0.13553
Damn it! Captain!
_0.13555
It doesn't resonate...should I pull it?
_0.13557
This feeling is good
_0.13559
At this rate...I'll retreat.
_0.13562
I can't lose to the captain either.
_0.13570
Would you like to do it?
_0.13579
Sorry
_0.13592
Leave the rest to me!
_0.13600
Is it okay if I come over here?
_0.13602
Show me your power
_0.13607
Make one shot!
_0.13613
Are you out of bullets?
_0.13621
It's a bit of a waste...
_0.13624
I'm sorry, but could you please help me?
_0.13639
Check out many Zentraedi machines! I will intercept you!
_0.13641
I also confirmed this! I will support you!
_0.13649
I have to go help!
_0.13653
I can't believe I'm failing in my support...
_0.13655
I don't understand why the island is floating.
_0.13657
It's so strange, isn't it?
_0.13659
The desert is so hot
_0.13661
It's no good just going out.
_0.13663
It's quite impressive when you see it up close like this.
_0.13665
It's a mysterious place
_0.13667
what up? Is something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.13669
Let's move on to the next goal!
_0.13675
Shall we return to the ship?
_0.13677
Well then, let's go back to the ship.
_0.13679
Sorry, I helped you.
_0.13681
I have to do this bow properly next time.
_0.13687
Let me go too.
_0.13690
The enemies around here are now destroyed.
_0.13697
Alto! Are you okay?
_0.13701
Alto! Leave the rest to me!
_0.13703
Luka! Leave the rest to me!
_0.13706
Don't do it, Alto!
_0.13709
Luca Angeloni is on his way.
_0.13711
Skull 3 launch preparations are complete.
_0.13713
Ha, yes! You can leave anytime.
_0.13715
I won't let you do it!
_0.13717
It was dangerous.
_0.13719
Phew.
_0.13721
Damn it
_0.13723
Wow
_0.13725
Eh, eh!
_0.13727
How about this!
_0.13729
What do you think?
_0.13731
It hurts!
_0.13733
Oh my god!
_0.13735
Wow!
_0.13737
Kuuuuuu
_0.13741
not yet
_0.13743
There's more!
_0.13745
It's a bonus
_0.13747
Me too
_0.13749
Simon, John, Peter, let's go!
_0.13751
I'll do it, I'll do it
_0.13753
Let's win. absolutely!
_0.13755
Locked the enemy.
_0.13757
That's it!
_0.13759
I found!
_0.13761
Don't treat me like a child!
_0.13763
If it's to protect everyone!
_0.13765
This is it!
_0.13767
I'll leave it like this!
_0.13769
Please stop unnecessary resistance!
_0.13771
Things are going well.
_0.13773
Confirmed the destruction of the enemy aircraft.
_0.13776
Even I have something I want to protect!
_0.13778
I’m coming!
_0.13780
I will never let you escape.
_0.13782
That seems like the target of the attack.
_0.13784
Confirm target destruction. feel well.
_0.13786
I couldn't let her escape.
_0.13788
It looks like it was successfully destroyed.
_0.13790
Shhh, the shield!
_0.13792
The shield has been destroyed!
_0.13794
Ah! The shield was damaged...
_0.13796
It's still okay.
_0.13798
No problem. I can still go.
_0.13801
It's quite formidable.
_0.13803
There must still be a way to reverse it.
_0.13805
With this much, I can't give up!
_0.13807
This is so good!
_0.13809
Oh, you can do it!
_0.13811
Even if it's unreasonable, I have to do it!
_0.13813
Such an idiot...!
_0.13815
Ugh! I can't believe I've gotten this far...
_0.13817
Still. still…. I'm more...
_0.13820
I never expected it to be destroyed...
_0.13822
Nanase-san...
_0.13824
Are you alright! ?
_0.13826
Everyone makes mistakes!
_0.13828
That's too unreasonable!
_0.13830
If only I had helped her sooner...
_0.13832
Please escape! Hurry!
_0.13834
Something like this...
_0.13836
Reinforcements! It was helpful!
_0.13838
This will change the battle situation.
_0.13840
Confirmed friendly forces.
_0.13842
This is terrible!
_0.13844
it's a lie…!
_0.13846
I couldn't protect it...
_0.13848
The mission is over. I will return.
_0.13850
Well done everyone!
_0.13852
Now you can go to school again!
_0.13854
Time over... My strategy is ruined...!
_0.13856
Looks like we're running out of time here...
_0.13858
You've come this far and your time is up!
_0.13860
Mission failed! ? I'm returning...
_0.13862
That's just me...
_0.13864
Unfortunately, it looks like the mission has failed.
_0.13866
Please support me!
_0.13868
May I ask for cover fire?
_0.13870
I step forward and look for the enemy's movements.
_0.13872
Bring it into close combat.
_0.13874
Step forward and engage in close combat.
_0.13876
I'll try like Michelle!
_0.13878
Please leave it to me and go back.
_0.13880
It is dangerous! Leave it to me!
_0.13882
You're pushing too hard like Alto-senpai!
_0.13884
Please do it!
_0.13886
This is the only timing!
_0.13888
If you use that, I'm sure...!
_0.13890
I…. Me too...!
_0.13892
This is a fight for survival!
_0.13894
If you use this, you will surely...
_0.13896
got it.
_0.13899
yes! I got it!
_0.13901
Captain! Damage!
_0.13903
Captain, I will support you!
_0.13905
Fight carefully. Captain!
_0.13907
Captain? Please respond! Captain!
_0.13909
The captain has been killed! ?
_0.13911
That's it... Captain!
_0.13913
Let's stop fighting and go home
_0.13915
Song... it's good
_0.13917
This...I'm withdrawing.
_0.13919
Amazing, as expected of the captain.
_0.13921
I have to learn from the captain too.
_0.13935
Why is this?
_0.13937
What should I do...
_0.13939
sorry…
_0.13941
I'll try not to hurt you
_0.13944
This much is me!
_0.13951
Leave the battlefield!
_0.13954
Please rest
_0.13956
Leave the rest to me!
_0.13959
fight as you like
_0.13961
I'm looking forward to your arms
_0.13964
Please gather around!
_0.13966
Let's stick together and take action here.
_0.13969
There's no need to worry!
_0.13971
This is the only place!
_0.13974
Please make an all-out attack!
_0.13978
I got it!
_0.13982
That's how you run out of bullets! ?
_0.13985
More bullets are consumed than planned! ?
_0.13988
No way!
_0.13992
Remove optional parts
_0.13995
Excuse me, may I help you?
_0.14011
I also confirmed this! I will support you!
_0.14013
It's the enemy!
_0.14015
It's Vajra!
_0.14017
It's Bandit!
_0.14019
It's a protective weapon!
_0.14021
It's Havamar!
_0.14023
It's Zentraedi!
_0.14027
Ahh! I didn't make it in time
_0.14029
Support failed! ? Why is this...!
_0.14031
The island is floating...
_0.14033
I think we can get new data here.
_0.14035
desert is expected
_0.14037
In this environment, it seems possible to obtain rare ores.
_0.14039
That's strange for ice.
_0.14041
When I return to LAI, I have to write a report about this planet.
_0.14043
What's wrong? Is something wrong with your aircraft?
_0.14045
Let's quickly move on to the next goal!
_0.14049
You're pretty far in, are you okay with the remaining bullets?
_0.14052
Return to the ship
_0.14055
appreciate
_0.14059
I'll do it!
_0.14061
I have to learn from you too.
_0.14064
Can I go too?
_0.14066
Please let me go too!
_0.14068
It looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.14070
Now all the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.14075
Mr. Lion! OK?
_0.14077
Alto senpai! OK?
_0.14079
Michelle senior! OK?
_0.14081
Mr. Lion! Leave the rest to me!
_0.14083
Alto senpai! Leave the rest to me!
_0.14085
Michelle senior! Leave the rest to me!
_0.14087
That's amazing, Leon!
_0.14089
That's amazing, Alto-senpai!
_0.14091
That's amazing, Michelle!
_0.14093
Ozma Lee, come on out.
_0.14095
Skull One comes out
_0.14098
I won't do it!
_0.14101
It's dangerous
_0.14104
Shit.
_0.14106
You!
_0.14108
Itadiya!
_0.14110
Not yet!
_0.14112
in the way!
_0.14114
Wow
_0.14116
Argh !!
_0.14118
Sorry!
_0.14121
Shit...
_0.14123
Ahh?
_0.14125
Get it.
_0.14127
Shame for you
_0.14129
Nun!
_0.14131
Well, let's get started
_0.14134
Operation begins, let's go.
_0.14136
It's late!
_0.14138
Hurry up and disappear!
_0.14140
Don't feel bad
_0.14142
This bastard!
_0.14144
Woooooooooooooooooo ―――― !! _
_0.14146
Fuck it!
_0.14148
Can you dodge it with a move like that?
_0.14150
Don't run away
_0.14152
Was he still alive?
_0.14154
My opponent was bad.
_0.14157
Is this the end?
_0.14159
What are you guys planning !?
_0.14161
Did it come out again?
_0.14163
Target appears, attack begins
_0.14166
Did you do it?
_0.14168
destroyed the target
_0.14170
Damn, is the shield crazy?
_0.14172
Shield!
_0.14174
Oops
_0.14177
Hmm !?
_0.14179
bean paste?
_0.14181
He's such a noisy guy!
_0.14183
You... !!
_0.14185
Guaaah
_0.14187
I see. That doesn't mean I'm not an amateur.
_0.14189
Huh...! This is such a scar!
_0.14191
Feel free to joke around!
_0.14193
What is that !!
_0.14195
If I get eaten!
_0.14197
I promised that I would never die
_0.14199
I never expected that I would be eaten...
_0.14201
Ranka...sorry
_0.14203
Did I spill too much blood...
_0.14205
Don't be lazy, I'm coming!
_0.14207
Hey, if you're going to be a hindrance, go home.
_0.14209
Don't push yourself, just go home once.
_0.14211
What's up, respond !?
_0.14213
Is the military short of manpower?
_0.14215
Run away quickly!
_0.14217
Reinforcements? Thank you for your cooperation.
_0.14219
Now we have the upper hand...?
_0.14221
Friendly forces?
_0.14223
Damn, you did it!
_0.14225
Damn it, I can't protect it!
_0.14227
Did you get hit...
_0.14229
Mission complete. held up well
_0.14231
Did I tell you? I'm not going to die
_0.14233
Operation completed, return to base
_0.14235
It's already late...?
_0.14237
Hey, it's time. ...Retreat!
_0.14239
Will you make it in time...
_0.14241
I was careful not to let this happen...
_0.14243
No good...I'll pull back now!
_0.14245
So far...
_0.14247
Support with shooting, okay?
_0.14249
Don't get too close! attack from a distance
_0.14251
use projectiles
_0.14253
Bring it into close combat
_0.14255
Get ready for a fight! ...Go!
_0.14257
Kill him in a fight
_0.14259
I'll stop this guy.
_0.14261
You're out too much!
_0.14263
Get as far back as possible
_0.14265
All Weapons Free! Do it!
_0.14267
Let me remind you of your power!
_0.14269
Go with all your might!
_0.14271
Do I have to go seriously?
_0.14273
Don't insult me?
_0.14275
Shall we end it soon?
_0.14277
Understood
_0.14280
All right
_0.14282
Captain, you've been beaten up quite a bit, haven't you?
_0.14284
You're not moving well today, Captain.
_0.14286
Captain, it would be better to return once...
_0.14289
Captain, captain!
_0.14291
The captain was defeated !?
_0.14293
Damn, I'm retreating.
_0.14295
No good, let's pull it out for now.
_0.14297
...Not bad, I'll go home.
_0.14300
We will follow the captain.
_0.14308
Follow me!
_0.14317
Sorry
_0.14333
I leave my back to you.
_0.14339
do your best!
_0.14343
ask for something fancy
_0.14345
Yay!
_0.14352
Have you run out of bullets?
_0.14359
No need now!
_0.14362
I'm sorry, but can I get some help?
_0.14378
I also confirmed this! I'll support you!
_0.14386
Help immediately!
_0.14391
It's a nice wind
_0.14393
That's a good place
_0.14395
I don't hate the heat
_0.14397
Everything is big
_0.14399
Ice?
_0.14401
This is...a strange place.
_0.14409
I'm going back to the ship.
_0.14411
Well then, let's go back to the ship!
_0.14413
You did a good job
_0.14417
That's amazing
_0.14419
You raised your arms again.
_0.14426
There's something around here
_0.14432
Dangerous! Basara!
_0.14435
Alto! Take a rest
_0.14437
Basara! Please stay safe!
_0.14439
Raise your arms, Leon!
_0.14441
Raise your arms, Alto!
_0.14443
As expected of Basara!
_0.14445
Clan Clan, let's sortie!
_0.14447
Preparations are complete. You can leave anytime.
_0.14449
Well, it's time to leave.
_0.14451
It's pointless!
_0.14453
It's boring.
_0.14455
Did you think you'd win?
_0.14457
Debran...!
_0.14459
This is it!
_0.14461
Nuuu
_0.14464
Woooooo ! _
_0.14466
I'll take another shot.
_0.14468
What a guy...
_0.14470
I never expected to receive a direct hit!
_0.14474
Shit!
_0.14476
That's shallow!
_0.14478
I took it!
_0.14480
This too!
_0.14482
One too!
_0.14485
Let's go first!
_0.14487
Well, let's get started
_0.14489
We've captured an enemy aircraft!
_0.14491
It's bad luck for you to notice me.
_0.14493
It's full of gaps.
_0.14495
This hurts!
_0.14498
Blow it away!
_0.14500
That's a good target.
_0.14503
I'll let you fall like this!
_0.14505
Because you're picking a fight with me.
_0.14507
That's weak.
_0.14509
I'm sure I'll win.
_0.14511
Finally, it's here...
_0.14513
I'll take him down!
_0.14515
That's it...
_0.14518
Alright! Target destroyed!
_0.14520
It's like this.
_0.14522
I never expected that the shield would be destroyed...
_0.14524
Damn it! Has the shield been damaged?
_0.14526
If it's just a shield, I'll give it to you!
_0.14528
Because it's made well. no problem.
_0.14531
There's still plenty of time.
_0.14533
Did I take too much damage?
_0.14535
The battle isn't over yet!
_0.14537
It's pretty easy to do, isn't it?
_0.14539
This guy...!
_0.14541
As expected, it's not good as it is.
_0.14543
Did I handicap myself too much?
_0.14545
It should still work! In that case!
_0.14547
This situation...is pathetic.
_0.14549
I'm feeling good!
_0.14551
Monster..., hell...
_0.14553
I wish I had been honest sooner...
_0.14555
Michelle―― ! _
_0.14557
I'm being followed!
_0.14559
Calm down! You idiot!
_0.14561
Calm down at times like this... Nice?
_0.14563
Don't die!
_0.14565
That idiot...
_0.14567
It seems like further education is needed.
_0.14569
Reinforcements? Thank you.
_0.14571
It was late. But it helps.
_0.14573
Let's keep this momentum going!
_0.14575
Damn it! My teeth are sore.
_0.14577
I can't believe I let him do this so easily...
_0.14579
Has it been destroyed? ?
_0.14581
The mission is over. I'm going home.
_0.14583
It looks like this strategy was a success.
_0.14585
Well, I guess I'll buy that idiot some tea.
_0.14587
If the time is up... Oh my god.
_0.14589
I never expected it to end like this.
_0.14591
Time is up. That's it.
_0.14593
Mission failed! I'm retreating!
_0.14596
I can still do it...!
_0.14598
Shoot me!
_0.14600
I asked for rear support.
_0.14602
I'll leave my back to you!
_0.14604
Push it in!
_0.14606
I'll provide rear support!
_0.14608
I'll leave the fighting to you!
_0.14610
Get down!
_0.14612
Hide behind me!
_0.14614
You're being too reckless. Stay back!
_0.14616
Come and be wild!
_0.14618
Show me your trump card!
_0.14620
If you're going to do it, now's the time!
_0.14622
I wonder if I can fall in love if I'm scared of dying!
_0.14624
This will help you succeed!
_0.14626
I wonder if it will end like this!
_0.14628
ah.
_0.14630
I know!
_0.14632
I know!
_0.14634
It looks like the captain is in danger. Provide support.
_0.14636
What are you doing! Captain!
_0.14638
Captain! Go down!
_0.14640
The captain has been defeated! ?
_0.14642
Please reply! Captain!
_0.14644
Damn it! I never expected something like this to happen...
_0.14646
Hmm, let's pull it.
_0.14648
This feeling... I'm withdrawing
_0.14650
...No, I'm going home.
_0.14652
As expected of a captain
_0.14654
It's only natural if you're a captain.
_0.14659
Let the battle begin!
_0.14663
Don't be late!
_0.14673
Be patient!
_0.14681
I'm retreating!
_0.14688
fight as you like
_0.14690
Leave my back to me.
_0.14694
I'll stay strong and take action.
_0.14697
here!
_0.14699
Show your strength!
_0.14702
now! Never take it off!
_0.14704
Go flashy!
_0.14713
Don't lick it!
_0.14715
Do you care?
_0.14719
You don't need this!
_0.14722
Can I get some help?
_0.14724
I would like you to lend me a hand.
_0.14739
Check this out too! I'll support you!
_0.14747
It would be bad if I didn't help.
_0.14752
Is the island floating? It's a strange sight
_0.14754
It's a beautiful sea
_0.14756
It's been a while since we fought in the desert.
_0.14758
Zentraedi weapons will not be destroyed by sand.
_0.14760
I don't remember much of this cold.
_0.14762
It's a pretty beautiful sight
_0.14767
I checked the reaction of an item nearby.
_0.14771
Shall we return to the ship?
_0.14773
Now, let's go back to the ship!
_0.14776
Thank you for your help
_0.14780
Don't try, but it's still not as good as me
_0.14783
I'll let you go too.
_0.14786
Looks like we've wiped out the enemies around here.
_0.14789
I feel like there's something going on around here.
_0.14791
It's suspicious over there
_0.14793
This area is suspicious
_0.14797
Milia! OK?
_0.14801
Milia! please rest
_0.14805
As expected, Miria!
_0.14807
It's Klang Klang. Let's go!
_0.14809
There should be no problem even if you keep it as a micro loan!
_0.14811
It's ready. I'll leave like this!
_0.14813
It's late.
_0.14815
It's lukewarm!
_0.14817
No hit.
_0.14819
Wow!
_0.14821
Suddenly
_0.14823
Coward!
_0.14826
You got it right!
_0.14828
Damn it!
_0.14830
Aaah ! _
_0.14832
What?!
_0.14834
It's noisy!
_0.14836
It's top notch!
_0.14838
Make a fool of yourself.
_0.14841
It's about time.
_0.14846
Let's start the operation
_0.14848
We'll show you our power!
_0.14850
I found it!
_0.14852
Don't run away!
_0.14854
I caught it!
_0.14856
It's so hot!
_0.14858
Now is the time to succeed!
_0.14860
I'll show you something!
_0.14862
That's a pretty good target, isn't it?
_0.14864
Not yet.
_0.14866
weak. weak.
_0.14868
What do you think?
_0.14870
Because you're picking a fight with me!
_0.14872
100 years too early to fight me .
_0.14875
You're going to knock that thing down!
_0.14877
If you leave it to me, there will be no problem!
_0.14879
You did it!
_0.14881
You've defeated the target!
_0.14883
I don't think I can do this much.
_0.14886
Just the shield makes me feel good!
_0.14888
The shield was destroyed!
_0.14890
This is just a scratch!
_0.14892
This doesn't mean I'm serious. It makes me laugh.
_0.14895
I'm not the type to be defeated at this level.
_0.14897
He's so cocky!
_0.14899
This guy!
_0.14901
It's still too early to complain.
_0.14903
I can still do it!
_0.14906
Even I would be Zentran size...
_0.14909
I never thought I would be able to do this...
_0.14918
That idiot is doing what he wants.
_0.14920
From now on, I'll train you hard!
_0.14922
I wasn't waiting for reinforcements!
_0.14924
Thank you for the reinforcements.
_0.14926
It does a pretty good job, doesn't it?
_0.14928
Has it already been done? ?
_0.14930
What a mistake what you did to me.
_0.14932
Damn it! Oh my god.
_0.14934
The mission is over. I'll go home early.
_0.14936
Operation successful. It was an easy win.
_0.14938
This much is just a little bit for me.
_0.14940
Time over... You're such an idiot.
_0.14942
Running out of time is such a sudden ending.
_0.14944
I won't accept this ending!
_0.14946
The mission has failed! I'm retreating!
_0.14948
Looks like that's it. Retreat!
_0.14950
Hell, if they hadn't made it into micro-clones, this would have been a great strategy...
_0.14952
Shoot!
_0.14954
I'll leave the shooting to you.
_0.14956
Please provide rear support.
_0.14958
Push it!
_0.14960
Come forward!
_0.14962
Fight back in a melee battle!
_0.14965
It's dangerous to do anything more reckless than this!
_0.14967
Do you want to die? You are!
_0.14969
I entrust it to you!
_0.14971
Let's do it!
_0.14975
Do whatever you want!
_0.14978
Hmm.
_0.14982
The captain is in a pinch! I'll support you!
_0.14986
The captain was defeated! ?
_0.14989
Damn! I never expected something like this to happen.
_0.14991
It's a song, it's good
_0.14993
Hmm, should I pull it?
_0.14995
This... I'm going to retreat.
_0.14998
I can do that much too.
_0.15114
Looks like you're ready to take off, let's take off!
_0.15116
It's Jeffrey Wilder, off we go.
_0.15118
I never thought I would be flying as a pilot again.
_0.15121
It was licked
_0.15123
It's lukewarm
_0.15125
What!
_0.15127
We need to rebuild right away!
_0.15129
I have to overcome the blank
_0.15131
Another shot!
_0.15133
This one hurts
_0.15136
What did you say! ?
_0.15140
No problem
_0.15142
Did you let your guard down?
_0.15144
It's just a scratch
_0.15146
There's more
_0.15148
Noga-san in this gap!
_0.15151
Please show your abilities to the fullest!
_0.15153
Unfortunately this is not a drill, get ready for battle!
_0.15155
I'll show you how a veteran fights
_0.15157
Reminds me of when I was young
_0.15160
acquired the target
_0.15162
Craaaaay!
_0.15164
Let's end this!
_0.15166
I'll let you decide!
_0.15168
Sorry, but I'll let you do it.
_0.15170
Let's just let it end like this
_0.15172
Don't let your guard down until the end
_0.15174
I think you underestimated my power.
_0.15176
Let's do it like this
_0.15178
It seems you didn't have enough experience to deal with me.
_0.15180
Get the biggest prize here!
_0.15182
Looks like that's the target of the attack.
_0.15184
Leave it to me to deal with him.
_0.15186
Confirmed target shot down
_0.15188
I can't handle this level.
_0.15190
I don't think my arms are weakening yet either.
_0.15192
Has the shield been damaged?
_0.15194
There's no way you can pull it off with just a shield!
_0.15196
I never expected that the shield would be destroyed...
_0.15198
I'll only fight a fight that has a chance of winning.
_0.15200
It still works fine
_0.15202
I won't fall at that level.
_0.15204
The enemy will do a good job as well.
_0.15206
I can't keep whining at this level.
_0.15208
It seems like we need a way to break out of this situation.
_0.15210
Now is the critical moment...
_0.15212
It's a little early to give up
_0.15214
It's been a while since I felt this tension.
_0.15216
I never thought I would be cornered this much...
_0.15218
I have to decide my own destiny...
_0.15220
There is still a chance of winning! I can't give up!
_0.15222
Looks like I've come this far too.
_0.15224
I guess it's not like it was when I was younger...
_0.15226
I never expected it to end like this...
_0.15228
Be careful
_0.15230
Calm down
_0.15232
Assess the situation calmly
_0.15234
Please escape immediately!
_0.15236
To be defeated...
_0.15238
I won't waste your work
_0.15241
Don't miss this opportunity!
_0.15243
Reinforcements here... Now, how will the war situation change?
_0.15245
There were too many sacrifices...
_0.15247
I just didn't have enough strength...
_0.15249
We can't let the war situation get any worse!
_0.15251
Thank you for your work!
_0.15253
I still can't lose to young people, hahaha!
_0.15255
It looks like the operation was a success, all troops are returning home!
_0.15257
When I say time is up, I'm getting old too.
_0.15259
What do you mean...time is up...
_0.15261
Time is up... everyone! Retreat immediately!
_0.15263
You guys did a great job, it's all my fault.
_0.15265
I never thought that I would end up with a failure...
_0.15267
I was also overcooked.
_0.15269
Turn to supporting fire!
_0.15271
I'll have you provide rear support.
_0.15273
Utee!
_0.15275
I'll have you play the avant-garde role.
_0.15277
Charge!
_0.15279
Step forward and create a diversion on the enemy!
_0.15281
Step back and assess the battle situation!
_0.15283
Get down! There's no need to rush to death
_0.15285
It's too far forward
_0.15287
You who take pride in my wings! Proceed with me!
_0.15289
Let me see your trump card
_0.15291
Show your strength
_0.15293
Let's go, you bastards!
_0.15295
Don't underestimate my power
_0.15297
I'll be a little more serious
_0.15300
Understood
_0.15303
You'll have to work a little harder, Captain.
_0.15305
It looks like the captain is in danger if things continue like this.
_0.15307
You're letting the captain do something unreasonable.
_0.15309
Transfer the captain's chain of command to me!
_0.15311
The captain was killed...
_0.15313
There's no time to be sad! We'll take care of the captain!
_0.15315
A song...reminds me of my younger days...
_0.15317
Fighting in front of this song is tasteless.
_0.15319
It's like the second coming of Lin Mingmei, retreat.
_0.15321
Well done Captain
_0.15323
We will follow the captain!
_0.15330
Let's start the operation now!
_0.15332
Well, let's go
_0.15339
Looks like I have no choice but to do it.
_0.15342
Sorry...
_0.15348
Looks like you did it
_0.15358
I'll leave it to you to decide
_0.15360
I leave my back to you
_0.15363
Could you please come here?
_0.15365
Please gather together.
_0.15367
Is it okay if you come here?
_0.15369
Show your power!
_0.15371
You can do it!
_0.15374
Let's hit it!
_0.15376
now! Don't let up on your attacks!
_0.15378
Please do it in a flashy way!
_0.15380
understood!
_0.15385
Do I need to replenish ammo?
_0.15393
Can you lend me a hand?
_0.15395
looks like you need help
_0.15418
Looks like I'll have to go help.
_0.15421
Didn't make it in time...
_0.15423
Couldn't you help me...
_0.15425
Good waves!
_0.15427
The wind feels good
_0.15429
I want to surf in this desert
_0.15431
It's spacious
_0.15433
It's a world of death, with ice as far as the eye can see.
_0.15435
There is beauty in silence
_0.15438
Let's move on to the next goal
_0.15440
There's something falling over there.
_0.15446
Well then, shall we return to the ship?
_0.15449
Thank you for letting me express my gratitude.
_0.15453
I need to improve even more
_0.15455
As expected!
_0.15457
I'll let you go too.
_0.15460
Looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.15462
It looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.15466
Looks like there's something over there
_0.15468
Lieutenant Leon! Are you okay?
_0.15470
Major Ozma! Are you okay?
_0.15472
Captain Max! OK?
_0.15474
Lieutenant Leon! I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.15476
Major Ozma! I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.15478
Captain Max! I'll leave the rest to you.
_0.15480
As expected of you, Lieutenant Leon!
_0.15482
As expected of you, Major Ozma!
_0.15484
As expected of you, Captain Max!
_0.15486
Brela Stern. Set out.
_0.15488
Antares One sortie preparations complete.
_0.15490
I understand the mission...
_0.15492
sweet….
_0.15496
what….
_0.15498
I made a mistake like this
_0.15501
Damn it.
_0.15503
This is the end.
_0.15505
Sit down.
_0.15507
Hmm. this is…!
_0.15510
It's dangerous...
_0.15512
I just scratched it.
_0.15514
Did it come true?
_0.15516
It's shallow.
_0.15518
Still.
_0.15520
It's full of gaps.
_0.15522
Don't remove it.
_0.15524
lets do it
_0.15526
Mission begins...
_0.15528
The mopping up will now begin.
_0.15530
Captured.
_0.15532
There it is.
_0.15534
I won't let you escape.
_0.15536
Disappear...
_0.15538
Scatter! To the end of the galaxy !!
_0.15540
Is the end….
_0.15542
Stop it already.
_0.15544
Not suitable for my opponent.
_0.15546
It's late.
_0.15549
Why did you fight me?
_0.15551
Destroy the enemy aircraft...
_0.15553
It's here...
_0.15555
Eliminate by force.
_0.15557
Acquire target. Destroy.
_0.15559
Confirm the destruction of the target...
_0.15561
It's for the sake of carrying out the mission...
_0.15563
in the way. Get out of the way.
_0.15565
Was the shield destroyed?
_0.15567
Has the shield exceeded its durability limit?
_0.15569
It's just that the shield is broken...
_0.15571
What a waste...
_0.15573
Minor damage. Continue the operation.
_0.15575
At this level.
_0.15577
There is no problem in carrying out the operation.
_0.15579
what is this….
_0.15581
I can still fight...
_0.15583
why…! ?
_0.15585
But! still!
_0.15587
The degree of damage continues to rise.
_0.15589
I can't afford to be defeated here.
_0.15591
Don't move yet...
_0.15593
Has the degree of damage reached the dangerous range?
_0.15595
Looks like that's it so far...
_0.15597
Is this the end of this empty fighting machine?
_0.15599
I can hear the song... That song that encompasses everything...
_0.15601
Is it really okay?
_0.15603
in the way. Stay back.
_0.15605
You are not fit for the battlefield.
_0.15607
Who were you fighting for?
_0.15609
Leave the battlefield.
_0.15611
I... I couldn't protect you...
_0.15613
Reinforcements?
_0.15615
Why did you come to help me?
_0.15617
Check reinforcements.
_0.15619
Confirmed the destruction of the defense target.
_0.15621
To be defeated...
_0.15623
I guess I couldn't protect it...
_0.15625
Ranka's true wishes... I will make it come true.
_0.15627
Executing the strategy is the reason for my existence.
_0.15629
The operation is over. Return immediately.
_0.15631
Is it time over? That's it.
_0.15633
Time's up.
_0.15635
Mission execution time exceeded. It's a failure.
_0.15637
Operation failed. Begin retreat.
_0.15639
What is the meaning of my existence...?
_0.15641
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise...
_0.15643
Give cover fire.
_0.15645
I'll provide rear support.
_0.15647
I'll be the vanguard.
_0.15649
I'll protect your back.
_0.15651
Come forward.
_0.15653
Move to close combat.
_0.15655
You stay back.
_0.15657
Avoid.
_0.15659
I'll protect you...
_0.15661
Now's the time to do it.
_0.15663
Aim now when the enemy is showing an opening!
_0.15665
Start an all-out attack.
_0.15667
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
_0.15669
Let it disappear...
_0.15671
I will defeat you. No matter what you do!
_0.15674
Ja _ _
_0.15677
I will protect the captain.
_0.15679
roger that. Go to support the captain.
_0.15681
It's going down. Captain.
_0.15683
Captain...! why…! ?
_0.15686
Really. I guess I couldn't protect it.
_0.15688
Phew...I'm retreating.
_0.15690
This feeling...I'm going to pull it
_0.15692
Let's stop fighting...
_0.15694
Captain, you're doing great.
_0.15709
Why are you hostile?
_0.15712
Why…
_0.15717
slow
_0.15719
I have no other interests
_0.15721
It's reckless
_0.15724
withdraw
_0.15726
leave the battlefield
_0.15728
leave the battlefield
_0.15731
Leave the rest to me
_0.15735
Don't get in my way
_0.15737
leave it to each person's discretion
_0.15739
Please gather here
_0.15743
Eliminate it with your strength
_0.15745
Fight without hesitation
_0.15748
Now! Wipe it out!
_0.15750
Kick it away!
_0.15760
this much
_0.15762
Damage level exceeds usage limit
_0.15766
can you lend me a hand
_0.15790
Looks like you need help
_0.15792
I'll come to the rescue immediately!
_0.15795
That I failed in my support! ?
_0.15797
It doesn't matter whether the island is floating or not.
_0.15799
I want to hear Ranka's songs in a place like this...
_0.15801
Heat doesn't work for me
_0.15803
I want to go out into space, into the universe that envelops me...
_0.15805
Even I know that this planet is unique.
_0.15807
Now I'm protecting this beautiful planet
_0.15809
I scanned it and there are no problems.
_0.15812
There's something falling over there.
_0.15816
It's a dead end
_0.15819
Now, let's go back to the ship.
_0.15825
Don't do it, but you can still become stronger.
_0.15830
Now we've wiped out all the enemies around here.
_0.15832
It looks like the enemies around here have been wiped out.
_0.15837
Lion! What are you doing?
_0.15839
Alto! What are you doing?
_0.15841
Chief Bowman! Are you okay?
_0.15844
Alto, that's your limit.
_0.15846
Chief Bowman! Leave the rest to me
_0.15850
As expected, Chief Bowman!
_0.15852
Hey, it's Ranka Lee! Thank you for your support!
_0.15854
I'm not sure if I can support you, but I'll do my best!
_0.15856
I've taken on an amazing job as a support person.
_0.15858
I feel so out of place.
_0.15860
Ugh, I'm getting really nervous.
_0.15862
Life is one-two deculture! Good luck me!
_0.15864
You can do it! absolute!
_0.15866
Let's do our best! I'm rooting for you too!
_0.15868
Let's do it gorgeously!
_0.15870
It's no more dangerous! Escape to!
_0.15872
Are you okay? Looks like it's hard
_0.15874
Wow, that's too unreasonable!
_0.15876
eh! You must be kidding…
_0.15878
Escape! quickly!
_0.15880
Because I don't have the strength...
_0.15882
Thank you for the reinforcements! happy!
_0.15884
Thank you for coming to my rescue.
_0.15886
I can feel a little more at ease now.
_0.15888
Yay! Eau de culture - the best! Kira☆
_0.15890
It was a success, right? Good~
_0.15892
It helped me a little too.
_0.15894
Wow! Don't treat me like a child!
_0.15896
I won't lose!
_0.15898
I'd rather shatter if I hit it than regret it!
_0.15900
Ha, yes!
_0.15904
Captain, are you okay?
_0.15906
do your best! Captain
_0.15908
Captain, it's dangerous if we continue like this.
_0.15910
Oh, I can't believe the captain is going to be defeated...
_0.15912
Captain!
_0.15914
Because of me...Captain-san...
_0.15916
As expected of the captain
_0.15918
Looking good... Captain
_0.15920
everyone! Embrace! To the ends of the galaxy!
_0.15922
Kira☆
_0.15924
Wind in your wings!
_0.15926
I will support you!
_0.15928
I'll do my best to help you
_0.15931
I'll do my best!
_0.15933
Let's do it!
_0.15937
Please rest
_0.15947
I have to go help!
_0.15949
I have to rescue you right away! Quickly!
_0.15951
Ahh! be not in time…
_0.15953
Something like that... something like this...
_0.15955
Wow, so beautiful!
_0.15957
Wow, it's like a fantasy world!
_0.15959
It's hot. Can I cool off by swimming in the oasis?
_0.15961
It's full of sand and looks amazing!
_0.15963
It's really cold...
_0.15965
The air is clear and the sky is beautiful!
_0.15970
There are items nearby!
_0.15972
You've come a long way! Aren't you tired?
_0.15975
Let's go back to the ship.
_0.15977
Okay! Return to the ship!
_0.15979
thank you!
_0.15984
I can't lose to you either!
_0.15987
I want to go too
_0.15989
Can I go too?
_0.15992
Looks like things will be quiet around here now.
_0.15996
I feel suspicious about this area.
_0.15998
Mr. Lion! Are you okay?
_0.16000
Alto-kun! Are you okay?
_0.16002
big brother! Are you okay?
_0.16004
Mr. Lion!
_0.16006
Alto-kun!
_0.16008
big brother!
_0.16011
That's amazing, Alto-kun!
_0.16013
As expected of a big brother!
_0.16015
I hate it when I can do something but don't do it!
_0.16017
I'm saying I'll support you, so be grateful!
_0.16019
I can provide some support! I'm Sheryl!
_0.16021
If a pilot's job is to fight... then my job is to support them!
_0.16023
Don't worry, you can do it...I'll do it!
_0.16025
Come running at macro speed!
_0.16028
Destiny is something you can grasp with your own power!
_0.16030
I'll give you the spotlight just for a moment.
_0.16032
It's nothing! this much
_0.16034
You have the courage to confront me.
_0.16036
Hmm... isn't that interesting?
_0.16038
Are you scared of such a lame threat?
_0.16040
Nothing like this!
_0.16042
You probably know what will happen if you do this!
_0.16044
It's okay, I'm Sheryl Nome!
_0.16046
My stage is yet to come!
_0.16048
You can't lose! This is me!
_0.16050
I'll definitely survive!
_0.16052
I won't give up!
_0.16054
I will fight even in despair!
_0.16056
That's me... Sheryl Nome...
_0.16058
That's all... I...
_0.16060
different! My power is not like this! My power is...
_0.16062
Are you exhausted already?
_0.16064
Don't give up easily!
_0.16066
a little bit! Do it seriously!
_0.16068
That's sloppy!
_0.16070
Looks like you need some punishment
_0.16072
Reply! I won't forgive you if you don't!
_0.16074
I don't really feel like it
_0.16076
Oh, are you my fan?
_0.16078
I'm asking for your support like this
_0.16080
I'm sure you'll be successful! This Cheryl is supporting me.
_0.16082
I'm telling you, it's all thanks to me that you succeeded.
_0.16084
It was a pretty good stage, although you might lose to me.
_0.16086
This kind of service is rarely available!
_0.16088
How dare you let Cheryl go this far!
_0.16090
Run at macro speed!
_0.16092
Got it!
_0.16095
Just do it!
_0.16097
Are you really the captain?
_0.16099
Stay strong! You're the captain!
_0.16101
You're an unreliable captain.
_0.16103
I never expected the captain to be killed...
_0.16105
There's no point in talking if the captain is killed.
_0.16107
I won't forgive you if you die! Captain!
_0.16109
Why don't you do it? I'll praise you.
_0.16111
As a captain, this is only natural.
_0.16113
Listen to my song!
_0.16115
Let's go! Everyone!
_0.16117
Sing a song to the galaxy!
_0.16119
I will support you!
_0.16121
I'll support you well!
_0.16123
We support you!
_0.16125
I won't lose!
_0.16127
I'll do it!
_0.16131
take a rest
_0.16134
I also confirmed this! I'll support you!
_0.16143
Please rescue me immediately!
_0.16145
Ahh! I didn't make it in time...
_0.16147
Something like that... something like this...
_0.16149
This is the real sky
_0.16151
It's like a fairyland...
_0.16153
It's really hot. Should I change into a swimsuit?
_0.16155
hang on! I think I can come up with a good phrase!
_0.16157
It's really cold. Maybe I'm wearing too little clothes?
_0.16159
...It's like a wonderland.
_0.16161
what happened? Are you feeling unwell?
_0.16164
There's something falling over there.
_0.16166
I checked the reaction of an item nearby.
_0.16168
You've come a long way, aren't you tired?
_0.16172
Now, let's go back to the ship!
_0.16174
I'll thank you.
_0.16179
I can't lose to you either.
_0.16184
It looks like there are no more enemies around here now.
_0.16187
I feel like there's something going on around here.
_0.16190
This area seems suspicious.
_0.16193
Alto! Are you okay?
_0.16195
Mina-chan! Are you okay?
_0.16198
Alto! take a rest
_0.16200
Mina-chan! take a rest
_0.16203
You did it, Alto!
_0.16205
That's amazing, Mina!
_0.16207
I will manage you

Hey Zentraedi!
_0.16304
I need to go help you.
_0.16306
If we don't go to the rescue immediately...!
_0.16310
I understand the theory, but...the island is floating...
_0.16312
That's great, I think it would be worth researching.
_0.16314
In this environment, I think we can get rare ores.
_0.16316
It's really full of sand and I'm covered in sand.
_0.16318
Glacier, there's that Fold Evil underneath...
_0.16320
It's truly an amazingly special place.
_0.16323
Let's quickly move on to the next goal
_0.16325
There's something falling over there.
_0.16336
At that rate, please hone your skills.
_0.16339
I want you to take me too.

_0.17048
Immediately dispatched...Oh, it wasn't the operator this time.
_0.17050
Be strong, if you fail, I'll give you a lecture.
_0.17052
I don't feel at ease even though I'm not an operator.
_0.17054
Don't be reckless, do you understand?
_0.17056
Show me your power!
_0.17058
Now! Get it done!
_0.17060

Rebuild it somehow!
_0.17067
That...what the hell...
_0.17069
already! Because you don't listen to me
_0.17071
What are you doing? Hmmm!
_0.17073
Reinforcements! I was saved.
_0.17075
Thank you for the reinforcements
_0.17077
Don't let your guard down just because reinforcements have arrived.
_0.17079
It looks like the operation was a success, thank you for your hard work.
_0.17081
Well, I guess you did a good job.
_0.17083
This is only natural, I supported you.
_0.17085

_0.17087
I can't leave it alone!
_0.17089

_0.17094
The captain isn't feeling well.
_0.17096
Stay strong, Captain.
_0.17098
Please stand back, Captain.
_0.17100
Immediately review the chain of command!
_0.17102
The captain was killed...
_0.17104
What... Captain...
_0.17106
As expected, the captain isn't just for show either.
_0.17108
Please keep this up
_0.17110
Hmmm! Do it seriously!
_0.17114
We will support you
_0.17116

_0.17137
What the hell?
_0.17139
It's beautiful here, the water is crystal clear.
_0.17141
It's amazing that the island is floating...
_0.17143
It's really hot...
_0.17145
No matter where I go, there's nothing but sand, and it's a bit depressing...
_0.17147
It's a very magical place
_0.17149
I feel like I'll be sucked in by the shine of the ice
_0.17151
what happened? Is there something wrong with the aircraft?
_0.17153
Let's move on to the next goal
_0.17165
Looks like you've improved a lot!
_0.17168
I'll let you go too.
_0.17171
Looks like we've wiped out the enemies around here.
_0.17173
Looks like you've wiped out the enemies around here.
_0.17177
I feel like there's something over there.

Ensign Sakaki! Please come back safely
_0.17185
Shining! Come back safely!
